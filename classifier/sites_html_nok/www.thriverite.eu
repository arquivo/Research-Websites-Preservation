<h2 class="mainheaderAll"><strong>Update (October 2015):</strong></h2>
<p class="greyText">The following short article below has been published by the EU, summarising the results of Thrive-Rite in five languages (English, Spanish, German, Polish, French and Italian). Please see <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/151566_en.html" target="_blank">http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/151566_en.html</a> for more details.</p>
<p class="greyText"><strong>"THRIVE-RITE Result In Brief: Validation of new technologies to replace in-feed antibiotics in pig and poultry production"</strong></p>
<p>An EU-funded project has validated new technologies for reducing pathogen, reducing mortality and improving life-time growth performance, maternal immune transfer and meat quality in pig and poultry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The THRIVE-RITE (Natural compounds to enhance productivity, quality and health in intensive farming systems) is an EU-FP7 project which aims to identify solutions to problems encountered in intensive monogastric animal production. These problems include rising food costs, ban on in-feed antibiotics and reduced productivity. The use of in-feed antibiotics to enhance growth and productivity on farms is no longer permitted (Regulations (EC) No. 1831/2003, 1334/2003). While use of in-feed antibiotics in pig and poultry has been reduced, the use of therapeutic antibiotics has increased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2013, the European Medicines Agency reported that exceptionally high levels of antibiotics are currently being administered by veterinarians in Cyprus, Italy, Spain, and Germany, raising concerns of an imminent rise of drug-resistant pathogens in the EU. The main reason for this problem is the lack of viable alternatives to banned in-feed antibiotics. Alternatives such as zinc oxide also face increased scrutiny due to environmental implications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THRIVE-RITE was established to solve the above problems. THRIVE-RITE consists of highly progressive enterprises with established records in developing feed additives: BioAtlantis Ltd. (Ireland), Clasado Ingredients Ltd. (Malta) and Drobex-Agro Sp. Z.o.o. (Poland). The enterprises have developed novel, natural-based products which enhance animal health, performance and immunity. THRIVE-RITE combines the technology of the enterprises with leading European research institutes and food producers, including: University College Dublin (Ireland), Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (UK), University of Science and Technology (Poland), University of Molise (Italy), Truly Irish Country Foods Ltd. (Ireland) and Drobex-Agro Sp. Z.o.o. (Poland).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A 2-Stage validation approach was employed in THRIVE-RITE, ensuring that findings from academia were also validated under large-scale commercial conditions. A range of products were validated to achieve the following: enhanced productivity as measured by ADG &amp; FCR, reductions in pig and poultry mortality, reductions in levels of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, increased antibody transfer to offspring via maternal transfer, enhanced gut health &amp; immunity and improved meat quality in pig &amp; poultry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Products validated in THRIVE-RITE include: BioAtlantis Ltd.: LactoShield&reg; (maternal application), SensoryPlus&trade; (application to finisher pigs to enhance meat quality), DiNovo&reg; (in ovo injection, poultry application), Clasado Ingredients Ltd.: Bi2tos&reg; (application to pig &amp;, poultry and in ovo injection), Drobex-Agro Sp. Z o.o: Lupin oligosaccharides (application to poultry and in ovo injection).</p>

<h2 class="mainheaderAll"><strong>Final Report now published</strong>:</h2>

<p class="greyText">The Final Report of Thrive-Rite has been  published. The full text report may be obtained free of charge by contacting the project coordinator via email at <a href="mailto:research@bioatlantis.com">research@bioatlantis.com</a>. The executive summary of the report is provided as follows:</p>

<p class="greyText">THRIVE-RITE  is a collaborative project funded by the EU Seventh Framework Programme (Ref:  315198, start date: 01/08/2012, end date: 28/11/2014). The aims of THRIVE-RITE  are to identify viable solutions to problems encountered in intensive  production of monogastric animals. These problems include: rising food costs,  lower producer margins due to lag effect (increase in input without increase at  retail level), ban on in-feed antibiotics, reduced productivity and the limited  effectiveness of current 'Solutions' to these problems. The use of in-feed  growth promoting antibiotic use is no longer a tool legally available to  producers to enhance productivity and control diseases on farms (Regulations  (EC) No. 1831/2003 and 1334/2003). These are also human implications to these  issues. While the ban on in feed antibiotics was intended to reduce the use of  antibiotics in production of pig and poultry meat, this has not happened and in  fact, the situation has worsened. Renewed concerns were raised in 2013 by the  European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding the increasing antibiotic use in the  EU, an article which appeared in Der Spiegel (<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/danish-pig-farmers-reduce-antibiotics-to-prevent-drug-resistance-a-933344.html" target="_blank">http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/danish-pig-farmers-reduce-antibiotics-to-prevent-drug-resistance-a-933344.html</a>). The statistics demonstrate that  huge levels of antibiotics are being administered by veterinarians in the EU. Cyprus, Italy, Spain, and Germany are the worst offenders and there are now major concerns of an imminent  rise of drug-resistant pathogens in animal production. The main reason for  increased antibiotics use is the lack of viable alternatives to in feed  antibiotics following their ban in 2006. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a widely used  alternative. However, it faces increased scrutiny as the majority of the 3Kg of  ZnO added per tonne of feed, is passed on through the faeces and into the  environment. </p>

<p class="greyText">THRIVE-RITE was  established to provide solutions to these problems. THRIVE-RITE consists of  highly progressive European enterprises with established records in developing  natural feed additives. The enterprises have developed novel, natural-based  products which enhance animal health, performance and immunity, as demonstrated  in numerous peer-reviewed publications. THRIVE-RITE combines the expertise of the  enterprises with a multidisciplinary team of scientists in some of Europe&rsquo;s  leading research institutes. The combination of enterprise and academia  provides a robust system in which to verify the use of these products in enhancing  animal growth, health and performance, a requirement increasingly being set in  modern agriculture. A dual approach was applied to validate the effectiveness  of the products. This involved a 2-Stage validation process in (a) the academic  setting and (b) large-scale commercial setting. This ensured that significant  findings from the university setting were subject to a 2nd round of validation  under large-scale commercial conditions. This provided a unique mechanism in  which to transfer scientific discovery within academia to direct provision of  solutions which are proven to be effective in commercial-scale production. The  main targets achieved by THRIVE-RITE are:</p>
