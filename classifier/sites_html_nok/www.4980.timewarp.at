<title>HydroWEEE - Innovative Hydrometallurgical Processes to recover metals from WEEE including lamps and batteries</title>

<meta name="description" content="The HydroWEEE projects deal with the recovery of base and precious metals from WEEE including lamps and spent batteries by hydrometallurgical processes. The idea is to develop a mobile plant using hydrometallurgical processes to extract metals like Copper, Manganese, Zinc, Yttrium, Indium etc. in a high purity of above 95%. By making this plant mobile several SMEs can benefit from the same plant at different times and therefore limit the necessary quantities of waste as well as investments. In addition this new HydroWEEE process will produce pure enough materials that they can be directly used by end-users for electroplating. Because of this 2 levels of intermediaries from today (bigger recyclers and secondary material processors) will be bypassed. This will make the SMEs much more competitive than today and reverse the general trend to bigger companies."/>
