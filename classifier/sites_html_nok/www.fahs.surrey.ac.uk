	      <p></p>
	      <p>PIDOP was a multinational research project that  was funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme.  The project examined the processes which influence democratic ownership and  participation in nine European countries – Belgium, Czech Republic, England,  Germany, Italy, Northern Ireland, Portugal, Sweden and Turkey. </p>
	      <p>The project drew on the disciplines of Psychology,  Politics, Sociology, Social Policy and Education to examine macro-level  contextual factors (including historical, political, electoral, economic and  policy factors), proximal social factors (including familial, educational and  media factors) and psychological factors (including motivational, cognitive,  attitudinal and identity factors) which facilitate and/or inhibit civic and  political engagement and participation.  </p>
	      <p> The project had a distinct focus on the  psychology of the individual citizen and the psychological processes through  which macro-level contextual factors and proximal social factors exert their  effects upon citizens’ civic and political engagement and participation. </p>
	      <p> Young people, women, minorities and migrants  were examined as four specific groups at risk of political disengagement. The  research explored the differences as well as the overlap between civic and  political engagement, and both direct and representative participation. </p>
	      <p> As part of the project, multi-level process  models of civic and political engagement and participation were constructed to  explain how and why different forms and interpretations of democratic ownership  and participation develop or are hampered among citizens living in different  European countries and contexts. </p>
	      <p> Particular attention was paid to relevant  phenomena at local, national and EU levels. Stakeholders at all three levels  were involved in the work to ensure that the research addressed issues of  concern to them and to ensure that the policy implications and recommendations  which emerged from the research were relevant to their needs. </p>
