<p style="text-align: justify;">It seems that UK stands at a lower ranking when it comes to the primary and preprimary science and math literacy. This is not just the case of UK, but we can see that generally the education for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) development is below average during the early stages of schooling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the quality of public primary and secondary education is decreasing this way, it is noted that only a fewer number young students lately show interest in STEM education, which may create a potential threat for this sector in future with lack of skilled and knowledgeable professionals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This scenario is not going to change until a considerable number of students pursue science and math graduations and develop the aptitudes to become skilled professionals. All these point towards the importance of getting the kids interested in science and math from an early age itself.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Government had initiated many projects to promote <a href="http://www.ed.gov/stem">STEM education</a> and many private institutions too focus on this aspect lately.

<p>Let&#8217;s face it: College is expensive! From tuition, meal plans, and everything in between, it is safe to say that college is a very expensive investment. Fortunately for you, knowledge is free.  Below is a list of the five most creative ways to save money during college.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Stay Local</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A great way to save money during college is to attend a school near your hometown. When you attend a college close to home, you can commute to campus, effectively saving you thousands of dollars by not having to pay for room and board.  Commuting sometimes receives a bad wrap but it shouldn&#8217;t. Commuters are still able to make friends and still fully able to experience life in college. The best part of being a commuter is your food will likely be better than what is served in the the dorm cafeteria; and don&#8217;t act like that doesn&#8217;t make you excited.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re fortunate enough to live near a community college, consider enrolling. These colleges are notoriously cheaper and still provide a world class education; do not let the stigma of community college scare you away.</p>

There are many options available to you; you just have to do the research and put the work into getting the assistance that you need. Here are 6 ways to save money on college tuition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong> Scholarships</strong></li>

This is also the case if you are a highly talented athlete and have already made it onto a college team. If you are not an athlete and you don&#8217;t have the most impressive GPA or test scores, then you may be able to find scholarships if you experience an unusual amount of financial hardship.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been in your shoes before. Sitting in a dorm room, mind racing, I remember scrolling over the hundreds of classes my university offered and wrestled with deciding exactly what electives I should take. Listen, I get it; college is expensive!  I can see why you don&#8217;t want to make a mistake.  In an effort to help you to learn from my past struggles, I have made a list that walks you through how to choose your college electives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Schedule Classes Efficiently</strong></p>
<p>You’re not in high school anymore. In college, you have the ability to schedule your own classes, giving you the freedom to plan your day so it best fits you and how you like to work! Yes, growing up does have its benefits. The goal of making a schedule should be to give yourself plenty of time to study and plenty of time to pursue your extracurricular interests. If you need to work during college, make sure you obtain a schedule where you can have either the mornings or afternoons off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Waste Your Electives</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I know bowling sounds fun, but unless your going to college to become a professional bowler, you should probably only sign up for electives that benefit</p>

<p>After you graduate from college, it is finally time to start looking for a job. With all the competition out there, it may seem impossible to land a position within the field you spent the last four years studying, but if you really pound the pavement you will be able to find employment. One thing that will give you a leg up is to have the job-hunting basics down. For one thing, you want to make sure your resume is spot on. Also, you want to make sure that you remain persistent when it comes to follow up. Here are some job hunting basics for college grads.</p>
<p><strong>Spiff up Your Resume</strong></p>
<p>Before you start looking for a job, you want to make sure your resume is spot on.  Ideally, you want to add on any additional education that you may have acquired since you last revised your resume. You also want to add on any internships that you may have been involved with during college or if you held a part-time job while working towards your degree. All of these things will help you land a job and they will make you stand out from the competition, which can be quite thick</p>

<p>For some people it can be extremely difficult to adjust to the real world once they&#8217;re done with college. For others it can be more or less straight forward. No matter where you stand on the spectrum, here are a few tips on how to adjust to the real world after college.</p>
<p><strong>Get a Job as Quickly as Possible</strong></p>
<p>This is easier said than done, but if you haven&#8217;t already found a job, or you aren&#8217;t at least already on the job hunt, it&#8217;s time to get busy. The longer you spend after college twiddling your thumbs, the harder it is going to be to get your life started. Even if you can&#8217;t find a job within the field that you were studying, you want to make sure you are earning money each month and paying your bills. If you don&#8217;t, you will have all kinds of debt and self esteem issues building up, which will only make it harder to get out into the work force.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Up with Current Events</strong></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t already keep up with current events, it&#8217;s time to start. Whether you want to watch the news, listen to the news on the radio, or read the paper, you</p>

This is when you really step out into the real world and show everyone what you&#8217;re made of &#8211; or possibly what you&#8217;re not made of. If you really want to succeed in life, you&#8217;re going to have to be prepared for the transition. Here are 5 ways your life will change after college graduation.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Find a Full-time Job</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You may have had a part-time job throughout college, but once you graduate, you will need to see about finding full-time work. Ideally, you will be able to find one full-time job that will pay the bills, but don&#8217;t be surprised if you can&#8217;t find one right out the gate. It is very likely that you will need to work multiple part-time jobs before you find your dream job.</p>

<li><strong>PurchaseYour Own Healthcare</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are attending <a href="http://graduate.norwich.edu/">Norwich University</a>, then you can visit the school health clinic whenever you have any kind of medical concerns. However, once you graduate, you will need to figure out a new healthcare plan. If you are under 26 years old, then you can still receive healthcare under your</p>

<p>There are many things in life that will be different when you go off to college and it&#8217;s impossible to be prepared for all of them before you arrive. That said, you should definitely try to prepare for those transitions as much as you can. If you really don&#8217;t know what to expect at all, here are 5 things that college-bounders should know.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Don’t SkipClass</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of college freshmen tend to start ditching lectures pretty early in the game, since it&#8217;s really the first time in their lives that they can actually get away with it. Unfortunately, though, college classes move very quickly and if you miss even one lecture, you could end up falling terribly far behind, and it will definitely take its toll when you take your next exam. If you skip lecture right before a midterm, you could be committing academic suicide.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Complete All Required Reading</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you go to <a href="http://www.accounting.nec.edu/">New England College</a> or Santa Monica Community College, you should always do all of your required reading. Not only will it show to your professors when you turn in homework, papers, and exams, but for the rest of your life it will be</p>

<p>Whether you graduated from <a href="http://www.onlinenursingdegrees.maryville.edu/">Maryville University</a> or University of Chicago, there is a good chance that you are going to be like most students when they leave college: eager, excited and a little relieved. However, it is important to know that the earlier you get a job and start making money, the earlier your college education will start working for you. It is important to start thinking about landing a job long before you even graduate. Here are some ways to land your first job after college.</p>
<p><strong>Sending Your Resume to as Many Employers as Possible</strong></p>
<p>Right before you graduate, you want to send out your resume to as many employers as you can send it to. This will help you reach out to a lot of different types of businesses and it will increase the probability that you will get called for an in person interview. The key is to get as many interviews as possible, because you want that face-to-face time to make a strong impression.</p>
<p><strong>Meet Employers</strong></p>
<p>If you are having trouble reaching out to employers, you may want to find out if there are any job fairs near you. Job fairs can be great because they allow you the</p>

<p>Post graduation stress is characterized as an acute feeling of, &#8220;what in the world do I do next?&#8221; Many people wonder why recent college grads get stressed, because why would they?  They are done with college after all.</p>

College students &#8211; whether they go to <a href="http://www.mbaonline.pepperdine.edu/">Pepperdine University</a> or another prestigious private school &#8211; may also get stressed because they can&#8217;t find a job right away. If you are a college student in this position, there are a number of things you can do to cope. Of course, there are unhealthy ways to cope, like procrastinating on your job search or drinking too much, and there are healthy ways to cope, but you want to strive for the latter. The truth is that coping with the stress will help you find a job and it will make you an all around happier person. After all, you should be enjoying graduation.

<p>In college, one of the most important things you need to do &#8211; besides go to class everyday and study &#8211; is to manage your money. You already won&#8217;t have much money to call your own, but you will have a little &#8211; and you will need some capital for daily expenses, books and more. However, many college students don&#8217;t know how to properly manage their money and they wind up spending more than they have. If you are on a tight budget, you want to learn how to stretch things as far as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Detailed Budget </strong></p>
<p>Your first step in managing your money more efficiently is to create a detailed budget. Without a detailed budget, you won&#8217;t know how much you have, how much you owe and how much you have coming in and going out each month. As a college student, you may not have much income, but you may have a lot of expenses, especially when it comes to debt, so you really want to be careful. Ideally, you want to create a daily budget and a monthly budget, and you want to stick to it as closely as possible.</p>

<p>A lot of college students don&#8217;t pay much attention to politics because they think that those issues don&#8217;t really affect them yet.  That couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth. If you&#8217;re not sure what you should be paying attention to, here are 5 political issues college students should care about.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> The Presidential Campaign</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>No matter who you are or what political party you align yourself with, you should be paying attention to the presidential campaign and the state of the union. So long as you are an American citizen, these things affect you. If you are not paying attention to the republicans and democrats alike, then you will not really know who you want to vote for, and if you&#8217;re not voting, then you&#8217;re not doing your civic duty, and you deserve to have a say in the leadership of your country.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Student Loan Reform</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Student loan reform is something that is constantly being revisited in politics. We all know that student loans are far too difficult to pay off and the big banks are really raking in the cash, while the rest of us struggle for years to pay for higher education. If you are currently surviving on student loans,</p>

<p>If you are getting ready to graduate from college, then you should definitely check out a job fair or two on campus before you finish school. If you go somewhere like <a href="http://communicationmgmt.usc.edu/">USC Online</a>, then you might want to check into job fairs at the closest university. This way you can get a head start on your job search before you graduate when the pressure is really on. Here are 5 benefits of attending a college job fair.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Start Networking</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing like face time when it comes to job hunting. Whenever an employer posts an ad for a job opening they are going to be looking at a lot of resumes. In that stack of resumes there will only be a few people that the employer has seen or spoken to, and if one of those people is you then you will have a huge leg up on your competition. When you start shaking hands, it&#8217;s effectively like getting an early, low-pressure interview before anyone else does.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Weigh Your Options</strong></li>

<p>College job fairs are great because you can get a very good idea of what kinds of jobs will be available to you when you graduate. In some cases, you</p>

If you use essay writing services top rated by <strong><a href="http://essayzwriting.com/">essayzwriting.com</a></strong>, then you may guarantee a higher score/mark on your essay. If you want your essays to score more highly through your own efforts, then take note of these tips.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G0cRXOi5ljI/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Write a bullet pointed plan</p>
<p>Writing a plan is essential, but it doesn’t have to be a big task. List your main ideas and the points you wish to make, and arrange them in the order you wish to enter them on your essay. You are not writing an essay guide, they are simply reminders of the things you wish to enter into your essay.</p>
<p><strong>Brainstorm your best ideas and try to add them all in</strong></p>
<p>You may have been advised to brainstorm and then add in your best ideas and points, but why not add them all. At the end, you can cut down your work and remove the undeveloped ideas. Or, better still, you can wait for your professor to add amendment notes where he or she may tell you which parts to remove.</p>

<p>If education is prerogative to every born individual, CEU has become an absolute necessity! </p>
<p> Today education doesn&#8217;t mean only to have a good degree and a strong career, rather there&#8217;s a need to polish the skills. Formal schooling years can give you a good job with a handsome salary, but unless and until you are not equipped with the latest techniques, you can&#8217;t find a niche in the ever competitive market. </p>
<p> Taking the need of a continuing education for polishing and crafting the knowledge within individuals, Continuing Education Units are designed. These have a special implication towards improving and enhancing the talents within an individual. </p>
<p> When it comes to healthcare sector, there&#8217;s a vehement need of CEUs in this dynamic sector. Medical science along with its discovery and innovation changes in every single minute. Hence people involved in this sector like the doctors, practitioners, physicians and nurses are required to take CEU courses in order to remain updated with the changing technologies of this field. </p>

<p>For people with a broad area of managerial interest who intend to enter a career in the hospitality industry, a hotel management degree or diploma is the best route. Thats because this type of hotel management education allows them to pursue a range of careers in number of areas, among which are managerial positions in: general management, accounting or financial, human resources, food and beverage, front office, sales and marketing and housekeeping. </p>
<p> It also equips students with various skills that include: ensuring a high degree of customer satisfaction by providing hospitality services in a professional manner; contributing to marketing and sales effectiveness to promote successful operation of a hospitality enterprise; and applying human resources and management knowledge to enhance performance as an employee and team member.</p>
<p> But how does one program train students of all of these areas and equip them with these skills? Centennial Colleges Hospitality Management Hotel and Resort program, which students complete in two short years, has it down to a science. </p>

<p>Abstracts The modern Physics is based on the findings and thinking of the people of historical age. If no one knows the base and work of the previous on a subject, he or she could mere develop a new thought or findings. For, a civilization must know its past. Hence, the present work is a small effort to find out the contribution of ancient Arabian and Egyptian scientists in the field of Physics and Technologyy. Different scientists of different school of thought, correlating different streams of science being Physics as a main subject, are described in the present work. Key Words: Arabian and Egyptian Scientist, Physics, Technology </p>
<p> The Muslim scientists studied deeply the fundamental questions of physics. For instance Ibn Sina made a profound study of such phenomena as force, motion, light, heat, vacuum, etc. A great progress was made in theoretical and applied mechanics. Useful work was done in the field of mechanics on the wheel, axle, lever, pulley, inclined plane, windmill, water-wheel, toothed wheel, etc. The physicist and astronomer al-Khazini wrote a book on mechanics, hydrostatics and physics, named Kitab Mizan al-Hikmah (Book of the balance of wisdom) which is the most remarkable medieval work on these</p>

<p>There is an old saying: Time moves on. That is certainly true in the world of education. In the past, higher education was strictly an option for the wealthy and privileged. Beginning in the last century, higher education became a reality for the common person. But the pace of change has not slackened up one bit!</p>
<p> And while the so-called &#8216;experts&#8217; argue among themselves about future trends, we know one thing for certain: technology has turned the world of higher education upside-down. It is now the primary delivery channel for millions of students worldwide &#8211; in the form of &#8216;Distance Education.&#8217; Coupling the power of the home PC with the interconnectivity of the Internet, distance learning is revolutionizing the educational landscape, right before our eyes.</p>
<p> Let&#8217;s put it in it&#8217;s most simple form: Distance learning means that a student can participate in class &#8211; in India, let&#8217;s say &#8211; when the school is located in Boise, Idaho. Distance is no longer an obstacle &#8211; in fact, distance from the school, from the instructor, or from one&#8217;s fellow-students has become irrelevant. What matters now is receiving the course content, whether one lives down the street or in another continent.</p>
