            <p>Working out at the gym might seem like it is impossible to fit in, but fortunately for you there are actually plenty of easy at home workouts you can do instead. The best part is, you probably already know most of these workouts and the real key is just in implementing them. Keeping that in mind, here are 5 great options and suggestions on how to use them.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Pushup Routine</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Pushups are a great way to improve your upper body strength and solidify your fitness level. Though you may have only learned regular pushups growing up, there are a wide variety of different types that you can use to exercise your back, triceps, shoulders, and different areas of your chest. In the morning, before you eat, or any time you have a couple of minutes, take the opportunity to do some of these pushups. Instead of just the standard ones, try close-grip, wide-grip, or decline pushups to work different muscles.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Lunges/Squats</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these great leg exercises will give you a strong foundation. Squats are great to perform when you are waiting on something, such as your water to heat up in the microwave or while you brush your teeth. Alternatively, lunges can be added in by simply substituting walking with lunging. If you do this all day, you’ll get a great leg workout.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Burpees</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Another great workout to add in when you have a few minutes here or there, burpees will get the blood flowing. The more you have time to do the better, but even if you just have a minute go ahead and squeeze some in. It works your legs, arms, and lungs, so be ready to get fit!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Isometric Abdominal Routine</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This one requires you to put aside at least a few minutes of your time, but the results will be well worth it. Simply get on the floor and hold a plank position for as long as you can. When you become tired, flip onto your raise both your feet with legs flat and hands with arms straight. Assume the “banana” position and hold this for as long as you can.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Stretches</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Going to a yoga class every morning might be great, but most people simply don’t have the time and/or the money to do so. Instead, you can start out your daily routine by doing some simple stretches and really improve your fitness level. For this, all you have to do is get up 5-10 minutes early, get out of bed, and start stretching. Perform basic shoulder stretches, triceps, calves, quads, and all other areas of your body. Even if you just spend 20-30 seconds on each muscle, after 5 minutes of stretching you can accomplish quite a bit.</p>
<p>Whatever your current fitness level, <a href="http://easytoeatright.com/easy-home-workouts/">these 5 easy at home workouts are sure to help</a> you make progress on your goals. Focusing on the key muscle groups, these different workouts will ensure you keep your muscles growing and burn as much fat as possible. Best of all, they don’t require any equipment to perform, which means you already have everything you need.</p>

<p>As more and more people are showing interests in buying Medicare policies these days. Lots of companies are providing insurances at very affordable rates. It is good to buy a plan after doing proper survey as it will help you in purchasing a good plan. Don&#8217;t go for policies having low rates as those may lack some necessary benefits. When purchasing an insurance plan look for the plan which provides you the most benefits. A plan low in rate can be of no use if it doesn&#8217;t provide you the required facilities.</p>
<p>Competition in the health insurance sector is increasing day by day. You should check carefully before purchasing a plan with the best health Medicare rates as insurers provide lots of attractive offers to lure customers. Often times these healths Medicare rates become useless. Consult your doctor or your friends before buying a competitive policy that will have the lowest rates.</p>

<p>The government made these Medicare plans to provide medical facilities to needy people at an affordable price. Medicare rates are made by government and are followed around the country. But these policy rates varies from plan to plan and the type of facilities you have opted.</p>

        <div class="entry clearfix">
            
                        
            <p>If you are like most individuals, one of the biggest challenges you have is dealing with an office job that keeps you at your desk all day. This sedentary work environment can make it much more difficult to work on your health and fitness. When you learn how to do <a href="http://easytoeatright.com/office-exercises/">some simple office exercises</a>, you can overcome this challenge and start moving towards a much healthier lifestyle.</p>
<p>Of course, the real key to working out at the office is finding something that anyone can do with ease.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Lunges</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the easiest workouts to bring into your office is the lunge. This simple movement helps you burn some extra calories and will strengthen your leg muscles, which are the largest group in the body. Use this exercise whenever you have to get up and go anywhere around the office. Sure, your coworkers might find it strange at first, but isn’t it worth it for the health benefits?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Calf Raises</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For those who want something less noticeable, you might consider doing calf raises at your desk. Simply stand up and perform this workout whenever you are on a phone call. One of the less obvious office exercises, it will still help you burn some extra calories. Do as many as you can at a time, feeling that burn in your calves.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Arm Circles</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Another exercise you can easily perform at your desk, arm circles are a great way to get your shoulders and upper body a bit of action. Simple spread your arms out and go in a circular pattern forward until it starts to burn. Then, reverse direction and continue. This can be great if you have a hands-free headset and are stuck on a long call.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Abdominal Desk Exercise</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, the best exercises don’t actually involve dynamic movement. For this exercise, simple sit up straight in your chair and tighten your abdominal muscles. To get the best results, breath in and let you stomach expand as you do. Force your abs to tighten as you hold your breath for a few seconds and then slowly exhale, keeping the abs as tight as possible. This can be a great exercise while you are stuck reading emails or typing.</p>
<p><strong>Office Exercises for Your Breaks</strong></p>
<p>Of course, one of the best times to get exercise at the office is when you are on an actual break. Rather than eat lunch and sit around socializing for twenty minutes, have a light meal and then go for a jog around the building. Alternatively, return to your desk a little early and get in some pushups. Whatever you do, breaks are a great time to stay active and fit.</p>
<p>Remember, just because you work in a closed environment does not mean you have to be sedentary all day. With the right approach and some ingenuity, you can turn your boring office job into a great adventure full of office exercises. Simply start implementing these into your workday and you will quickly start noticing the results.</p>

        <div class="entry clearfix">
            
                        
            <p>Raw diet promotes beauty. To begin with, one reaches his or her ideal weight more readily and maintains it with much less effort than on a cooked diet. Many people lose 15 pounds in a month or two with no feeling of deprivation whatsoever. Obese people lose much more than that while eating raw fats all they want, including raw &#8220;ice cream,&#8221; avocados, nuts and olives. Raw fats (from avocados, olives, nuts, seeds, coconut butter et al.) are actually needed by the body to maintain youthful skin, hair and glands. They are rich in the essential fatty acids linolenic acid and linoleic acid that are denatured by heat.</p>
<p>Raw food pioneer Dr. Ann Wigmore wrote, &#8220;The effectiveness of live foods and fresh juices, especially wheatgrass juice, has bankrupted many complex theories about why we become fat and how to reduce quickly &#8230; Among our guests at the [Hippocrates Health] Institute, the average weight loss per week is between four and fifteen pounds&#8221; (The Wheatgrass Book, p. 59).</p>
<p>Studies have shown that raw food is less fattening than the same food cooked. According to Dr. Edward Howell, raw fats are not fattening and seem to belong in &#8220;a special pigeonhole in nutritional speculations&#8221; (Enzyme Nutrition, p.109). While cooked fats accumulate in the body and become very detrimental to our health, raw fats contain lipase (deficient in many obese people), the enzyme involved in metabolizing fat properly.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;Eskimo&#8221; means &#8220;raw eater,&#8221; as the Eskimos traditionally ate nothing cooked but subsisted chiefly on raw meat and blubber. Dr. V. E. Levine examined 3,000 primitive Eskimos during three trips to the Arctic and found only one person who was overweight.</p>
<p>Cooked starches are also very fattening. Farmers have even learned that it is necessary to feed their animals cooked food to fatten them up for maximal profit. Hogs do not get fat on raw potatoes, but cooking the potatoes makes them gain weight.</p>
<p>In addition to reaching your body&#8217;s ideal weight, many other beauty factors blossom on a raw diet. Cellulite, which is thought to result from eating heated fats, gradually disappears with the consumption of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. On a raw diet, elimination of cellular waste and increased lymphatic drainage helps remove cellulite.</p>
<p>As the body&#8217;s old cells are replaced with new, healthy cells through proper nutrition that only a raw diet provides, your hair grows in thicker and at times wilder. It may even regain color after having been gray, as did Ann Wigmore&#8217;s. Your skin may become as soft and smooth as it was in your youth. Your nails will be strong, clear and shiny. Facial lines may fade or disappear; the face&#8217;s pasty, white complexion becomes ruddy or rosy. People may remark on how much younger you look. Your eyes will sparkle.</p>

            <p>Well-known in Crete for its anti-aging properties, Dittany of Crete (Origanum dictamnus) is a rare and valuable herb that has many benefits for health and wellness as an aromatic, therapeutic and healing wild-grown plant. Dittany of Crete is seen as a &#8220;miracle cure all&#8221; by the Cretans who live on the beautiful Greek Island of Crete. Dittany of Crete, known also as Diktamos, grows wild only on Crete, and nowhere else in the world. And for thousands of years, since Minoan times, it has been used as a healing herb by the locals.</p>
<p>But Dittany of Crete need not just be classed as a healing herb. It has been used since ancient times as a beauty remedy too. Even the Greek goddess of beauty and love, Aphrodite used Dittany of Crete!</p>
<p>And today, thousands of years later, great interest has been shown in the natural beauty remedies made using Dittany of Crete. The rejuvenating anti-aging facial treatments and anti-cellulite body creams are proving to be the newest, most groundbreaking and most talked about innovative beauty products today.</p>
<p>Dittany of Crete has been scientifically tested as an effective treatment for skin conditions, for anti-aging, and helping reduce cellulite. This herb is also a good stress reliever. We all know that a stressful, demanding and worrying lifestyle leads to premature aging, so it makes sense to try to reduce stress.</p>
<p>Try these natural beauty remedies all using Dittany of Crete.</p>
<p>Stress Reliever</p>
<p>Throw a handful of dried Diktamos or a few drops of Dittany of Crete essential oil into a warm bath. The powerful, healing properties of Diktamos will be absorbed through the skin as you soak, and leave you feeling relaxed and de-stressed.</p>
<p>Relaxing Massage</p>
<p>Have a relaxing, stress relieving aromatherapy massage using Dittany of Crete essential oil.</p>
<p>Cellulite Reducer</p>
