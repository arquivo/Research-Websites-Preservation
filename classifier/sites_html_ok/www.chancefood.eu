The CHANCE final leaflet includes photos of the CHANCE blueberry-based products and pizza which have been developed to meet this need. The CHANCE foods were not only found to be healthy when compared to already existing products and the market place, but their smell, taste and appearance were attractive too.</p></div></li><li class=""><h4 class="news"><a href="http://www.chancefood.eu/podcast-chance-foods--importance-sustainability-and-wider-dissemination_77.html">Podcast: CHANCE foods – importance, sustainability and wider dissemination</a></h4><span class="date">2014-07-11</span><div class="htmltext"><p>New podcast recorded about the final results with three key researchers from the CHANCE project.

Healthier foods are often expensive to manufacture and purchase, which can have a detrimental effect on the eating habits of those on a low income. The CHANCE project has identified a number of barriers towards healthy eating, the nutrients which are under or over consumed in those at risk-of-poverty and has developed healthy, affordable foods. Researchers also found that CHANCE products are indistinguishable from brand products and could compete well on the market.
