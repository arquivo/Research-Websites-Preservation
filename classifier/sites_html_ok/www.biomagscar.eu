						<p>The BIOMAGSCAR project addresses the specific aims and objectives of the EU-FP7 Call: Health.2011.1.4-2: Tools, technologies and devices for application in regenerative medicine.</p>
						<p>Our ultimate objective, using the magnetic biodegradable stent as a tool, is to reduce the incidence of in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. With a bare metal stent, in-stent restenosis rates are nearly 16% at 1 year, if by 2010 1.5 million stents are used in Europe each year and approximately half are bare metal there is a potential for 120,000 instances of angiographic in-stent restenosis leading to target lesion revascularisation. On the basis of an incidence of stent thrombosis of 0.8%, approximately 12,000 European citizens per year will suffer a thrombotic event.</p>
						<p>Our objective is to halve the number of patients that suffer from either of these fates, and in so doing reduce patient suffering, furthermore, we believe this project will reduce the wider direct and indirect healthcare and societal cost of stent restenosis and thrombosis by €2.7 billion per annum to European society. We have developed a detailed programme of work to deliver these strategies culminating in human clinical trials.</p>
						<p>This work will be undertaken by a very strong consortium that brings together academic groups from the coordinating institution University College London (UK) as well as Queen Mary University of London (UK), the University of Eastern Finland (FI) and Yale University (US). The SMEs that are involved in the research and the exploitation of the products produced are QualiMed (Germany), Magnus Invention Management (UK) and FinVector Vision Therapies (UK). There is also a specialist project management company in the consortium, Euram Limited (UK), to assist the project team in delivering all the required documentation to the European Commission and provide day to day support to the coordinator.</p>
						<p>In relation to this project, the academic applicants are the inventors on four patents, which are now held by the SMEs, therefore ensuring the exploitation of successful research.</p>
