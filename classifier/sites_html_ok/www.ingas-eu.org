		<h4>Motivation</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Natural gas:</b> vehicles were introduced on the market more than 10 years ago; nevertheless, today’s market share of compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles is relatively small but rapidly increasing. The market introduction of dedicated (mono-fuel) CNG vehicles requires the development of technologies able to solve problems today not yet solved concerning gas storage, gas feeding, combustion system and aftertreatment and, at the same time, to take into account the quality of natural gas.</li>
			<li><b>Security of energy supply:</b> from this point of view, natural gas represents a real alternative to crude oil being available in large quantities also in countries different from the Middle East.</li>
			<li><b>Clean fuel:</b> natural gas is a clean fuel since toxic compounds like sulphur, or potential toxic, like benzene and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, or highly reactive such as olefins, are absent.</li>
			<li><b>Reduced Greenhouse gases:</b> the highest hydrogen content of methane molecule, with respect to any other hydrocarbon based fuel, allows achieving a substantial reduction of the carbon dioxide (CO2) exhausted by NG vehicles of about 23% compared to gasoline.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Scientific &amp; technological objectives</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Latitude of NG composition:</b> it is well known that natural gas quality depends on the source of extraction and for this reason the gas composition has to be clearly defined because affecting the storage system, the combustion and aftertreatment. The project will consider not only natural gases of different composition but also mixtures of natural gas with biogas and with hydrogen, in order to assure a multi-grade fuel tolerance and a high fuel flexibility by adopting specific technologies of gas feeding and combustion control systems.</li>
			<li><b>Vehicle range:</b> natural gas requires an advanced, purpose-designed storage system able to guarantee a range equivalent to that of conventional vehicle while maintaining a sufficient vehicle trunk capacity achieved by appropriate vehicle architecture.</li>
			<li><b>Combustion:</b> a highly efficient and low polluting combustion process, assisted by a dedicated aftertreatment system, affects the following three main sub-objectives:
				<ul>
					<li class="round"><b>Fuel conversion efficiency:</b> the combustion system shall enjoy the high octane number of methane and the other natural gas characteristics by adopting specific technologies to be verified in engines to achieve a very high efficiency under different driving conditions</li>
					<li class="round"><b>Fuel neutral emission targets</b></li>
					<li class="round"><b>Catalyst conversion efficiency:</b> the main duty of an advanced catalyst technology for CNG vehicles would be the development of dedicated methane catalyst, with higher conversion efficiency (respect to gasoline vehicle catalyst ones) at similar or lower level of cost. Moreover, the catalytic system has to account also other types of combustion process than the stoichiometric one until now investigated.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>GANTT CHART of the project</h4>
		<img src="/img/gantt.png" alt="Gantt Chart" />
		<br /><br />
		<h4>Overall strategy of the work plan</h4>
		<p>The objective of the INGAS project is to deploy a custom designed engine integrated with specific aftertreatment systems applied to a light duty (LD) vehicle able to achieve a 10% higher fuel conversion efficiency than that of a corresponding 2006 diesel vehicle and complying with an emission level lower than Euro 6. Additional features are advanced storage systems and vehicle architectures, as well as multi-grade fuel tolerance and fuel flexibility. The overall implementation plan gives an overview of the activities defined in the project.</p>
		<img src="/img/slide.jpg" alt="Project Overview" />
		<p>To achieve the project targets, the horizontal sub-projects B0, B1 and B2 will provide the three enabling technologies to the vertical sub-projects A1, A2 and A3 comparing the three technology ways. Strong interactions exist among all the sub-projects, both horizontal and vertical ones.</p>
