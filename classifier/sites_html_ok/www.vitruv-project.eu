                The northern part of the Borough includes large areas of business and commercial districts, whereas the southern tip in Dulwich is largely sub-urban residential; between these we have some very large area regeneration projects, including Elephant&amp;Castle and the Aylesbury and Heygate estates, with over 5000 new homes planned. The northern part of the Borough is also the focus for some very large investment developments, such as Renzo Piano's The Shard (the tallest building in Europe) and a new station being developed for London Bridge.</p></td>
