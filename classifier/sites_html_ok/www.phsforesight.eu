<p>This initiative builds on the European FP7 project ‘<a title="‘PHS Foresight’ Project" href="http://www.phsforesight.eu/project" target="_blank">Personal Health Systems Foresight</a>’ with the objective to provide a forum for long-term coordination and strategic guidance across different PHS areas of application such as chronic disease management, life-style management, independent living and emergency services.</p>
<p>Our aim is to bring these different streams closer together through sharing, commenting and assessing visions on PHS. Visions can be totally new creations or they can build on others’ work and include respective references. All in all we look for visions that are novel, relevant and feasible looking out to 2030.</p>
<p>Welcome to co-create PHS Futures!</p>

The same result was found in an examination of R&D personnel employed in the higher education sector and the government sector, for instance in government research institutes. In 2010, 23 persons per 1,000 employed persons worked in R&D position in Finland. Seven of them worked in the higher education sector and three elsewhere in the government sector. (Academy of Finland, 2012). According to the State of the Union Country Report 2013, Finland has strong innovation performance overall and outperforms its reference group in terms of highly skilled human resources. However, the share of new doctoral graduates was lower in Finland than in the reference group in 2011. The main weakness of the Finnish innovation system lies in its low level of internationalisation. Finland performs below the EU average in inward BERD, share of foreign doctoral students and participation in EU excellence–driven funding programmes. In Finland there were 2,9 new doctorate graduates (ISCED 6) aged 25-34 per 1000 population in 2009 (Eurostat).   There is a need to attract more qualified researchers and other labour in order to support and sustain the relatively high level of Finnish research and innovation system that was ranked in top five by the Innovation Union Scoreboard 2013. The amount of researchers has risen during the past few years. This has not, however, been reflected in the share of foreign researchers or in the mobility of either students or staff at Finnish HEIs. Persistent weaknesses in the Finnish research system for attracting researchers from abroad include limited career opportunities for researchers with few permanent positions and therefore a dependence on short term funding, the remuneration level has been lower than in many other European countries, families and especially spouses have had difficulties in getting a job, and the administration issues, for instance in universities, have also been seen as a challenge. There are rules and practices to help foreign researchers to work in Finland. Information is fragmented however and there has not been a dedicated programme to facilitate the immigration of foreign experts. Partly due to above challenges, the private sector has recruited relatively low numbers of foreign researchers except the few international businesses.   Enhancing international cooperation is considered important in Finland because it is closely linked to the degree of internationalisation of science and the mobility of researchers. The governmental programme to ensure that recruitment policies are developed in a way that makes research careers, both studying and working in Finnish universities and Higher Education Institutions, more attractive. An action plan for making research careers more attractive was launched in 2007. The Finnish universities are fully autonomous as employers under the Act on Universities (2010) and thus the Ministry of Education and Culture is not at all involved as a negotiating partner in the employment contracts of the academic personnel. Strategy for the Internationalisation of Higher Education Institutions in Finland 2009–2015 orients the recruitment processes in higher education institutions.   National legislation offers a code on research practice and national bodies advise on practice and misconduct. Finland established a research code in 2002 offering guidelines on good scientific practice and dealing with instances of misconduct. This includes a National Advisory Board on Research Ethics, which amends and imposes the guidelines and offers a point of call for business research that might be in breach of them. Furthermore, publicly-funded fellowships, stipends, grants or equivalent provide sickness, unemployment and old-age benefits for researchers. The principles of the European Charter for Researchers’ & the ‘Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers’ were signed by the Rectors\' Council of the Finnish universities and the Academy of Finland in 2009. The principles are being promoted through national higher education and research policy. However, in a survey of early stage researchers in twelve European countries, only 3% of the Finnish respondents have ever heard of the Charter & Code (EURODOC, 2011).  Research and Innovation Policy Guidelines for 2011–2015 defines a measure to attract international students, researchers and experts. The recruitment practices of higher education institutions and research institutes are changed to attract international students, researchers and experts. It includes a measure to enhance access to research funding of American researchers in Finland. The Ministry of Education will increase its annual appropriation to the Fulbright Center by 50% from 2010. The extra investment aims at directing a larger share of the Fulbright Center funding to supporting talented young researchers, teaching cooperation between higher education institutions and inviting top American researchers to Finland. The Academy of Finland has signed the Money Follows Researcher (MFR) agreement, the initiative of the recently dissolved European Heads of Research Councils (EUROHORCs).  The FiDiPro –programme is one of the tools established in Finland to tackle the issue of attracting talent from abroad alongside the rather new four-tier career model. Additionally Joint Degree Programmes have been initiated in Finnish universities to target foreign students aiming at Master’s Degree level. So far the actions taken have not improved the situation and therefore other policies or measures should be considered.   The Academy of Finland has a commitment to promoting the internationalisation of Finnish science and research by establishing bilateral agreements with countries and regions. The Academy of Finland provides funding for the Finnish Centres for Excellences (CoE) in order to support international cooperation in research. More could still be done, however, as Finland is not considered a hotbed of scientific research and fails to attract foreign researchers on a larger scale. Financing to support the outflow of researchers is provided especially by the Academy of Finland and Tekes. Publicly funded grants or fellowships by the Academy of Finland are portable to other EU countries. However, administrative processes remain problematic, thus discouraging researchers from going abroad. National grants or fellowships by the Academy of Finland are open equally to all nationalities subject to the research conducted being to the benefit of Finland to some extent. For specific mobility support, the use of EU mobility schemes is promoted.   The ‘National Guidelines for the Development of Doctoral Training’ (2011) have been prepared for the universities. Since 2011, all Finnish universities have started the reform of the doctoral training system in line with the principles of innovative doctoral training.    5.1.2 Research Infrastructures  For a small country like Finland, it has been pertinent to participate in organisations building large research facilities, namely:   •	Finland participates in the work of many international research organisations, notably: •	European Organization for Nuclear Research CERN •	European Molecular Biology Laboratory EMBL •	European Space Agency ESA •	European Southern Observatory ESO •	European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ESRF. “Growth through expertise: Action plan for research and innovation policy” of RIC in 2012 launched a measure that allocates funding for research infrastructure. Appropriations for the budget line item on research infrastructure will be confirmed for 2014 to 2017. In addition, funds from the structural fund period will be directed to research infrastructures that are either national or located in Finland and networks supporting them. The FIRI Committee (Finnish Research Infrastructure Committee) prepares the update of the national roadmap for infrastructures during the year 2013. “National-level research infrastructures: Present state and roadmap” in 2009 defines the roadmap for research infrastructures. The roadmap consists of 20 projects for the roadmap of new infrastructures or ones that are to be significantly developed. Thirteen of them are associated with European researched infrastructures proposed by ESFRI. The roadmap includes twelve recommendations for developing infra-structures in specific disciplines are presented along with thirteen general recommendations concerning 1) the establishment of infrastructural entities and the improved utilization of infrastructures, 2) Finnish participation in international research infrastructures and ESFRI projects, 3) funding, and 4) research infrastructure policy.   The same roadmap estimates annual budgets for the development of research infrastructures. It is estimated that the additional costs of implementing the roadmap will total approximately €30 million per year, while the costs of current national and international research infrastructures are around €160 million a year. Funding will also be needed for local research infrastructures. The present project reiterates the proposals of earlier work-ing groups concerning the need for an organ at the national level, a research infrastructure council, to prepare and implement research infrastructure policy and its funding.  “Research and Innovation Policy Guidelines for 2011–2015” of RIC states also that a new research infrastructure body is established that will prepare and implement a national and international infrastructure policy, which is in line with the ERI policy guidelines, and its evaluation and funding.  There is no dedicated hard or soft law governing funding organisations’ or research performers’ participation in bilateral or multilateral research programmes. However, ministries, agencies have established their own practices and programmes that increasingly allow cross-border access to RIs. Most recently also means for higher education institutions have been improved to allow cross-border access to RIs.   5.2. Getting good ideas to market  5.2.1 Improving access to finance  Several instruments supporting new R&D performing firms have existed in Finland for some time. One of them is the R&D project funding of Tekes that consists of grants and loans and plays an important role in the policy-mix. In the projects Tekes is responsible for half of the funding is provided while a corresponding proportion of private funding is also required. One relevant shift (although not visible in the policy measures but their funding) is the increased fraction of R&D-funding allocated to SHOKs. This increase mirrors the efforts of focusing national strengths and top know-how to some key areas that are hoped to be competitive in global networks.  The MEE has established a Growth Enterprises group within the Enterprise and Innovation Department, which bears responsibility for structuring, developing and implementing the growth enterprise policy, as part of the broad-based innovation and industrial policy. The emphasis on growth enterprises has led to the establishment of the VIGO accelerator programme (launched by MEE in 2009) designed to complement the Finnish innovation ecosystem by bridging gaps between early stage technology firms and international venture funding. Through VIGO, target enterprises can gain access to both private and public funding sources. The programme is coordinated by Tekes. Other notable incubators aimed at supporting growth enterprises are, for example, Startup Sauna, the Spinno Enterprise Center and the Aalto Start-Up Center.  Tekes, on the other hand, has reformed its strategies and instruments aimed at better supporting new growth enterprises. In particular, project funding for businesses, according to the new strategy, will be targeted in the following ways: •	One third for young SMEs •	Roughly one third for established businesses with less than 500 employees •	Less than one third for businesses with more than 500 employees if external impacts on other actors are significant, or if the company is essentially reinventing its business operations Funding will be channelled through different operating methods, which are: •	Around 40% for customer initiatives based on demand; •	Around 20% for research programmes of the Strategic Centres for Science, Technology and Innovation (SHOK); •	Around 25% to focus areas through Tekes programmes; •	Around 15% to other strategic choices Alongside Tekes, the Growth Company Service of EnterpriseFinland provides funding instruments to support SMEs. Additionally Finnvera (a specialised financing company owned by the State of Finland), VeraVenture (subsidiary of the former), Finnish Industry Investment and regional ELY-Centres all have instruments that support innovative start-ups. Most of these instruments are related to general funding support for businesses but in many cases these also target (innovative) start-ups.  Public sector financing support has also been directed towards seed-financing and loans. Finnvera plc, Sitra and Tekes represent public financing on equity terms. Seed financing is provided amongst others by Seed Fund Vera Ltd and the Finnish Industry Investment through the Financing Programme for Early Stage Companies. Tekes has a wide range of funding instruments to support innovation in businesses. Tekes provides for instance, funding for start-up businesses through the “Young Innovative Companies -programme”. Innovation is one of the key criteria for funding, as the firms operations have to be based on an innovative business idea based on specific expertise or new technology. Another instrument launched by Tekes is the Funding for the purchase of innovation services that aims at promoting business development of innovative SMEs.   The Nordic Growth Entrepreneurship Review 2012 reports that Finland nurtured 92 young growth enterprises in 2006–2009, whereas both Norway and Sweden were able to support over twice as many. The young growth company birth rate is 0.56% in Finland and 0.70% in Sweden. On the bright side, it seems that the Finnish growth enterprises grow faster and become larger than their Nordic peers. The same review also states that in the course of 2012–2013 Nokia, and to a lesser extent some other established businesses in the Finnish ICT sector, will release some ten thousand highly skilled individuals to the local labour market. Nokia has been very active in supporting the entrepreneurial efforts of those that leave the company. Depending on the case, it may offer to pay the individual’s wage in excess of one year, even if the work continues at a start-up. Additionally it may provide tens of thousands of euros per company in direct support and loan guarantees. It may donate or sell patents and other forms of intellectual property to start-ups with plans to exploit them. MEE and other public organizations also have measures that are directly targeted at former Nokia employees. In the end of 2012, they had established some three hundred new businesses.   During 2013 there were two tax incentives introduced aimed at growth seeking businesses (see Section 2) and the government agreement on scaling up venture capital funding provide relevant instruments for developing growth entrepreneurship.    5.2.2 Protect and enhance the value of intellectual property and boosting creativity  IPR are covered namely by Trademarks Act, Trademarks decree, Patents Act and Design Right Act. Under the Trademarks Act, the sole right to a trademark as a special identifier may be registered for goods that are to be offered for sale or otherwise traded as part of business activity, in order to distinguish them from other goods and services. Design right protects goods or a part of its outward form. The National Board of Patents and Registration of Finland (PRH) promotes technical and economic development and intangible rights, both in Finland and internationally. The Finnish Business Information System (BIS) is an information processing system jointly maintained by the National Board of Patents and Registration and the Tax Administration which enables the required information to be submitted to both authorities with a single notification. The Ministry of Employment and the Economy\'s website has information about industrial property rights and innovation.		  In 2012 the government action plan for research innovation policy referred also to the national IPR strategy that accounts for challenges related to the internationalisation of the operating environment; a new feature related to the competition over the geographical location of Enterprises consists of special incentives to do with the taxation of income obtained through the utilisation of the immaterial property rights of businesses. Indeed, the Government budget for 2013 includes two tax incentives aimed at growth seeking businesses.  5.2.3 Public procurement  Prior to 2009 the role of innovation oriented public procurement was quite modest in Finland but the development of public procurement in research and innovation policies is underway and high on the political agenda. For instance the Research and Innovation Policy Guidelines for 2011–2015 (2010) places emphasis on public procurement by referring to it as one of the key tools of demand driven innovation policy. The development of public procurement is also one of the key themes in the action plan and policy framework for demand and user-driven innovation. The main key barriers in implementing demand-side policies in Finland are the small domestic markets and to some extent the dispersed local government sector. As a result active participation of Finnish organisations to the EU Lead Market is seen as a very important approach in the action plan by the MEE. On the other hand the small markets can possibly work as an efficient pilot market for global innovations. One of the Tekes programmes also targets innovative public procurement since 2009. Its main aim is to encourage businesses to develop new innovations, renew public services, increase productivity, and to create new markets. An additional aim of the programme is to promote the use of public procurement as a tool for innovation policy as well as to develop good practices. Action plan for research and innovation policy (2012) discuss also possible new policy instruments related to innovation enhancing public procurements.  The above mentioned action plan refers also to the reform of the Act on Public Contracts, so that public procurements pay greater attention to innovation activity perspectives. A target level is set to directing one per cent of public procurement towards purchasing of new solutions in the cleantech field. The generation and diffusion of innovations is promoted by setting a target percentage (such as 2 or 3 per cent) for public procurement that enhances research, development and innovation activities. Expertise in procurement is enhanced by strengthening and developing comprehensive support and advisory services in matters of public procurement related to innovation. Financial and other incentives for procurement related to innovation are developed as part of the Effectiveness and Productivity Programme of central government and the productivity.  Innovation and research policy has been increasingly connected with societal issues (for example, globalisation, ageing, the environment and public health) that pose a challenge to growth and well-being. These challenges can be tackled with public sector innovation (or public procurement), growth entrepreneurship, service innovation as well as user and demand driven innovation. Tekes also has a specific programme “Innovations in social and health care services 2008—2015” targeting issues related to society and well-being.   5.3. Working in partnership to address societal challenges  The country has several hot– spot clusters in key technologies on a European and world scale, in particular in ICT, environment, materials, energy, security, and food and agriculture. By mid-2012, almost 1700 Finnish entities had participated in an FP7 project, with a total EC financial contribution of € 558 million and a success rate of 22.42 % (slightly above the EU average of 21.95 %).   Finland is active in both participating and coordinating European ERA-Net projects. Finnish research organizations, companies and associations participate actively in EIPs, while the ministerial level engagement varies. In Raw Materials EIP Finland is represented in the High Level Steering Group by GTK, Geological Survey of Finland is in HLSG and in Sherpa, but there is no ministerial representation. Smart Cities and Communities EIP has VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland represented in the High Level Group. The level of activity has also been good in Joint Programming Initiatives (JPIs), Joint Technology Platforms (JTPs) and Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs). There is no dedicated hard or soft law governing funding organisations’ or research performers’ participation in bilateral or multilateral research programmes. Finland participates in the European research area ERA groups: -ERA Committee ERAC -Joint programming group GPC -Steering Group for Human Resources and Mobility SGHRM -Strategic Forum for International S&T Cooperation SFIC -European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures ESFRI -Knowledge Transfer group  Growth through expertise: Action plan for research and innovation policy of RIC in 2012 initiates a national programme to ensure the best possible utilisation of EU’s research and innovation activities, such as the Horizon 2020 programme, is created as part of the efforts to promote the internationalisation of the research and innovation system. The national support and advisory service for the applicants of EU funding is renewed accordingly.  Research and Innovation Policy Guidelines for 2011–2015 of RIC plans that in addition to the EU, the partnerships to be prioritised within international cooperation include bilateral agreement countries in scientific and technological cooperation and the FinNode countries. The same guidelines set the objective for the engagement in EU funded research and innovation. \"The share of EU funding of the entire research and innovation funding of universities and research institutes is doubled in the 2010s (5.8% in 2009).” The same guidelines articulate opening up national programmes and national funding. Programmes are opened up in a way that makes room for voluntary joint pilot projects of member states. Effective principles, procedures and criteria are sought and legislation is harmonised. Finland should participate in the most promising trials.   Strong research alliances exist with other Nordic countries, expanding into the Baltic region. In general, the Government provides strong support for bilateral agreements, support for common pots in exceptional cases. Research cooperation with areas adjacent to Finland Nordic cooperation is expanding to the Baltic states, arctic research, and cooperation with Russia. An organisation called NordForsk promotes cooperation among the Nordic countries. (Ministry of Education and Culture, 2013.)   5.4. Maximising social and territorial cohesion  The Regional Innovation Scoreboard 2012 accompanied by the “Regional Innovation Scoreboard 2012 Methodology report” covers four regions in Finland: Itä-Suomi (FI13), Etelä-Suomi (FI18), Länsi-Suomi (FI19), Pohjois-Suomi (FI1A), Åland (FI2). According to the scoreboard Finland is an innovation leader, but 2 Finnish regions lag behind in their innovation performance, in particular Åland (FI2) which is a moderate innovator. Finland has a mix of different types of regions, being the low user/absorber regions of most importance in both periods (40%), together with full users/absorbers in the period 2000-06. Etelä-Suomi (FI18) is the only FP leading absorber region, whereas Itä-Suomi (FI13) became a SF leading user in the period 2007-13. Currently, four regions take part in the S3 Platform of the European Commission:  •	Ostrobothnia;  •	Lapland; •	Satakunta; •	Päijät-Häme (Lahti).  In the programming period 2007-2013 the Centre of Expertise Programme has been administered by the MEE and it has formed national clusters of expertise to enhance networking between the regional centres of expertise and to function as the new platform for development of inter-regional co-operation. The cluster-based operational model is expected to enable a more efficient utilisation of resources scattered in different regions, and is also intended to increase the “critical mass” for R&D activities in these fields. For the new programming period, a total of 13 clusters with national significance were selected with a total of 21 regional Centres of Expertise participating in these clusters. However, it covers research policy and related activities only indirectly by pooling local, regional and national resources for the exploitation of top-level expertise. The programme supports regional strengths and specialisation by launching co-operation projects between the research sector, educational institutions and industry.  For the Finnish government to attain the targets of regional development in Finland it has drawn up special programmes, of which the Centre of Expertise Programme (OSKE) is on-going. The government action plan for research and innovation policy foresees that regional cooperation will be intensified with the INKA (Innovative Cities) programme to be launched at the start of 2014 and which will replace OSKE. The programme encourages major urban areas in Finland to choose strategic focus areas and generate competence-driven business with the help of new kinds of development environments and lead markets. The aim is to use investments in development made by the state and the urban regions in order to generate openings that are based on international competence and also provide international visibility. Resources from structural funds from the period 2014–2020 are directed to comparable projects in innovation clusters. Major land use, housing and traffic infrastructure projects implemented in cities will be used as new types of development and testing environments for innovations. A region-specific negotiation procedure will be created for the most significant innovation clusters, with participation from national financiers, such as the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes), the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and, where necessary, the Ministry of Education and Culture and other ministries. The growth agreement, also coordinated by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, requires cities making choices in accordance with the Smart Specialisation Strategies of the European Union.     5.5. International Scientific Cooperation  Internationalisation of science has been a policy objective in Finland for quite some time, but so far the results of the policy measures have been modest. According to report on the state of scientific research in Finland 2012 only 13% of the researchers in Finnish universities were foreigners. The same report also notes that co-publishing with foreign researchers has increased considerably since 1990; between 2006 and 2009 49% of scientific publications were co-published with foreign researchers. The share of foreign R&D-investment as a share of private R&D in Finland was 7% in 2010 (OECD, 2012), which is low in international comparison. In this light, it is not surprising that specific strategies for internationalisation have been designed for the higher education sector as well as for the Academy of Finland.  It has been noted that a particular challenge for Finland in its efforts to attract foreign talents relates to research and innovation environments and researcher salaries in the public and higher education sectors, which in many cases have not been competitive enough (Viljamaa et al., 2010). Many other countries have also invested more in developing national research infrastructures than Finland, for example, with concrete investment programmes for several years (Viljamaa et al., 2010). The university reform addresses partly these challenges (see, Section 2).  The 2012 government action plan for research and innovation policy recognises that Finland has not utilised the opportunities offered by European and other international research funding to a sufficient degree: “Finnish researchers’ knowledge of the application process, their objectives and activity with reference to the research programmes of the European Union are not at a sufficient level. Increasingly systematic utilisation of international research funding strengthens the preconditions for research and innovation activities and helps Finland develop its scientific expertise. A national programme to ensure the best possible utilisation of EU’s research and innovation activities, such as the Horizon 2020 programme, is created as part of the efforts to promote the internationalisation of the research and innovation system. The national support and advisory service for the applicants of EU funding is renewed accordingly.”  The same action plan requires systematic utilisation of international research funding. Finnish researchers’ knowledge of the application process, their objectives and activity with reference to the research programmes of the European Union are not at a sufficient level. Increasingly systematic utilisation of international research funding strengthens the preconditions for research and innovation activities and helps Finland develop its scientific expertise.  Tekes has collaborative partnerships with several countries, such as the USA, Japan, China and European countries. The FinNode Centres (global network of Finnish innovation organisations operating via nodes in global innovation activity) in China, India, Japan, Russian and the USA are also valuable instruments for international cooperation.    Annex 1.

(+) The National Reform Programme 2013 intends to diversify the business structure, in particular by hastening the introduction of planned measures to broaden the innovation base. In particular, the programme notes that in order to accelerate economic growth in 2013 and 2014, a tax incentive for research and development activities, double depreciation right as well as tax relief for investments in 2013–2015 will be utilised.        Annex 2. Delivering ERA   Finland has generally taken an active role in participating in the ERA. The European dimension is seen as a natural extension of the national policy for a small country with limited resources. In the report setting the research and innovation policy guidelines for 2011-2015, the Research and Innovation Council stated that “Finland is a proactive and influential partner in the EU and in the initiatives of the European research and innovation policy, such as in deepening cooperation within national R&D programmes and promoting top-level European research”.  Based on analysis of the strengths and weakness of Europe\'s research systems and the overall objective of inducing lasting step-changes in Europe\'s research performance and effectiveness by 2014, the European Commission has defined the following ERA priorities (2012): •	More effective national research systems  •	Optimal transnational co-operation and competition  •	An open labour market for researchers •	Gender equality and gender mainstreaming in research  •	Optimal circulation, access to and transfer of scientific knowledge.   While the Finnish R&I system has a long track-record in addressing these priorities strongly related with the challenges discussed earlier in this report, there also is an urgent need to upgrade the system to develop these areas further.    1.	More effective national research systems   With regard effective research systems Finland has long experience in developing national, Nordic and European research programs encouraging healthy competition. Apart from universities and other higher education institutions (HEIs), facilitation of knowledge demand takes place through interactive joint preparation of various R&D programmes and other measures. The most important of these have been the research calls in the Strategic Centres of Science, Technology and Innovation (SHOKs), which have been jointly prepared by the stakeholders from the private sector, public sector and the higher education sector.   On the other hand Finland has a tradition of utilising the infrastructures and experimental arrangements of other countries. The work (discussed in Section 2) towards new national research infrastructures is a step into the right direction, but it is still too early to judge the success of the actions. The national regional policy liaises with the European Union (EU) cohesion policy. For the next period of the EU Structural Funds 2014-2020, research and innovation are among the priorities. In Finland, the focus is expected to be on enhancing infrastructure and capacities, promoting business R&I investment and a range of innovative actions through smart specialisation as well as supporting technological and applied research, pilot lines and early product validation.  2.	Optimal transnational co-operation and competition   Finland is well represented in the European research landscape, being a member of all major European research organisations (European Organisation for Nuclear Research, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Space Agency, European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility). Additionally Finland is active in both participating and coordinating European ERA-Net projects. The level of activity has also been good in Joint Programming Initiatives (JPIs), Joint Technology Platforms (JTPs) and Joint Technology Initiatives (JTIs).   The 2012 government action plan for research and innovation policy recognises that Finland has not utilised the opportunities offered by European and other international research funding to a sufficient degree: “Finnish researchers’ knowledge of the application process, their objectives and activity with reference to the research programmes of the European Union are not at a sufficient level. Increasingly systematic utilisation of international research funding strengthens the preconditions for research and innovation activities and helps Finland develop its scientific expertise. A national programme to ensure the best possible utilisation of EU’s research and innovation activities, such as the Horizon 2020 programme, is created as part of the efforts to promote the internationalisation of the research and innovation system. The national support and advisory service for the applicants of EU funding is renewed accordingly.”  The other important funding agency in Finland, Tekes has collaborative partnerships with several countries, such as the USA, Japan, China and European countries. The FinNode Centres (global network of Finnish innovation organisations operating via nodes in global innovation activity) in China, India, Japan, Russian and the USA are also valuable instruments for international cooperation.   3.	An open labour market for researchers  There is a need to attract more qualified researchers and other labour in order to support and sustain the relatively high level of Finnish research and innovation system. The amount of researchers has risen during the past few years due to an efficient graduate school system. This has not, however, been reflected in the share of foreign researchers or in the mobility of either students or staff at Finnish HEIs. Persistent weaknesses in the Finnish research system for attracting researchers from abroad include limited career opportunities for researchers with few permanent positions and therefore a dependence on short term funding, the remuneration level has been lower than in many other European countries, families and especially spouses have had difficulties in getting a job, and the administration issues, for instance in universities, have also been seen as a challenge. There are rules and practices to help foreign researchers to work in Finland. Information is fragmented however and there has not been a dedicated programme to facilitate the immigration of foreign experts. Another issue has been the insufficient willingness of the private sector to recruit foreign researchers except for the few international businesses.   The FiDiPro –programme is one of the tools established in Finland to tackle the issue of attracting talent from abroad alongside the rather new four-tier career model. Additionally Joint Degree Programmes have been initiated in Finnish universities to target foreign students aiming at Master’s Degree level. So far the actions taken have not improved the situation and therefore other policies or measures should be considered.   Enhancing international cooperation is considered important in Finland because it is closely linked to the degree of internationalisation of science and the mobility of researchers. The Academy of Finland has a commitment to promoting the internationalisation of Finnish science and research by establishing bilateral agreements with countries and regions. The Academy of Finland provides funding for the Finnish Centres for Excellences (CoE) in order to support international cooperation in research. More could still be done, however, as Finland is not considered a hotbed of scientific research and fails to attract foreign researchers on a larger scale.    4.	Gender equality and gender mainstreaming in research   According to a study in 2009 the Government programmes and the Government Action Plans for Gender Equality have incorporated ambitious objectives for the promotion of gender equality in higher education and in the field of science. The objectives during the period of review have included dismantling segregation, reinforcing gender sensitivity in teacher education, promoting women’s research careers, and establishing the status of women’s studies. Based on the results of the study, university and science policy had included relatively few concrete measures that enable the integration of gender equality into all actions regarding higher education and science. The long-standing gender equality work of the Academy of Finland has served as an example of how gender equality issues can be successfully integrated into activities. In 2011, more than 50% of the public sector research and development personnel were women (Academy of Finland, 2012).  5.	Optimal circulation, access to and transfer of scientific knowledge   The 2012 government action plan for research and innovation policy identifies the following action points in view of research and innovation information management.  •	The public data resources may function as a raw material for research and innovation much more effectively than has been the case so far.  •	The Ministry of Finance is about to launch an Open Data programme by which the public sector will expedite the opening and availability of data as concerns its own data resources.  •	The action plan further notice that effective utilisation of public sector data in innovation activities requires the expedition of application and service development projects implemented by businesses, the strengthening of research, education and training and advisory services concerning the opening and utilisation of the data as well as new support services that can be used, among other things, to strengthen the innovation activities of communities utilising the open data and the development of data resources to be implemented in cooperation between public authorities and users.  The public-private partnerships are mainly facilitated through the Tekes R&D programmes as well as the SHOKs. Instead of being only a shareholder the private sector is also involved in planning the strategic research agenda for the research programmes coordinated by the SHOKs. As discussed in Section 2, despite major advances SHOKs require further adjustments in the Finnish research and innovation policy.     Table to be completed after the submission of the ERA Communication and integrated in the final version of the report) Please use traffic colours in ERA Action Code column to indicate the progress: - red – insufficient/ inefficient policies/ no policies - yellow- progress has been made but further improvement is needed - green – goals achieved.
