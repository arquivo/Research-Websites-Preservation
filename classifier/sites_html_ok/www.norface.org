<div class=righttitle>Evaluation Report</div>
<p>
An evaluation of the research programme "Re-emergence of Religion as a
Social Force in Europe" was undertaken by the NORFACE consortium. This
research programme started in spring 2007 and ended in December 2010;
during which ten research projects and two capacity building projects
have been funded. The NORFACE Religion Programme probed the current
conditions of religion in Europe against the background of European
secularism and the re-kindling of religious activity brought about by
the political and social changes in Europe of the past thirty
years. Overall, the Review Panel concluded that the NORFACE Religion
programme has proved to be a good instrument to stimulate excellent
scientific research, develop a European research community, and tackle
themes of importance for European public policy. More information can
be found in <a href="http://www.norface.org/docs/27042012_NORFACE_Relemerge_Evaluation_Report_final.pdf">the evaluation report</a>.

<div class=righttitle>Launch of NORFACE-II Support Action</div>
<p>
From September 2011 the NORFACE partnership continued in the shape of
the NORFACE-II Support Action. The NORFACE-II Support Action aims at
further deepening and strengthening the established trans-national
co-operation. This new cooperation has been brought about with the aid
of the European s Seventh Framework Program. The project will last
until March 2013.
<p>
The new NORFACE work plan (2011-13) consists of three work
packages. Work package 1, <i>Joint Research and Related Activities and
Initiatives</i>, deals with the planning and development of a new
multidisciplinary research programme: 'Welfare State Futures' and
activities aimed at removing and lowering barriers to trans-national
research collaboration. Work package 2, <i>Exploiting Data & Research
Infrastructure in the Social Sciences</i>, aims to develop co-ordinated
strategies and approaches between the NORFACE Partners for the future
enhancement and exploitation of the social science data and
research. Work package 3, <i>Governance and Management of the NORFACE
Network, and Output, Dissemination and Impact</i>, deals with project
management issues.
