                        <h2>What is an electric scooter, anyway?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://autochunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/26-MPH-Electric-Scooter.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="525" /></p>
<p>If one collects information on the Internet about <a href="http://genielectric.com/"><strong>best electric scooter</strong></a>, there are two models: firstly, the scooter, which is now available already with electronic engine; secondly the small scooter, most of us still know from childhood and they are motorized, too.</p>
<p>The electric scooter is a motorized vehicle with two wheels which combines a moped type chassis to a motor powered by electrical energy (stored in batteries).</p>
<p>On average, electric scooters can run 50 km on their battery, at an average speed of 45 km / h.</p>
<p>This vehicle, therefore, tends to attract more urban. Especially since the search time is relatively long, four hours, knowing that the higher the price of an electric scooter remains more expensive than a traditional scooter.</p>
<p>If the government offers incentives in the form of subsidies for electric cars, this is not yet the case for scooters.</p>
<p>How to convince the consumers to buy an electric scooter? Beyond the satisfaction of not badly affect the environment, the electric scooter has another argument: the cost of maintenance. Quite low, it would be based on average around 50 cents per 100 km.</p>
<p>Scooter insurance side, the rates are lower than a cover for thermal scooters.</p>
<p>Scooters are available with the engine. Motor drive is of course much more convenient, than come into the pedals or having to push with your foot. If everything still works without fuel, fine. For this reason, more and more transport means are constructed with electric motors. This also includes electric scooters, you can sometimes buy street legal. But you should check in advance exactly how one later this purchase did.</p>
<p>This article focuses on the motorized scooter. It seems quite similar to normal scooter, but it has especially a saddle (bicycle seat) and you must have road legal, even lighting and mirrors on the handlebars so that you will be seen and may even keep track.</p>
<h2>More information on the legal electric scooter street</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://assets.inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Stigo-Electric-Scooter-Riding.jpg" alt="" width="537" height="481" /></p>
<p>Anyone who wants to buy a the electric scooter, he really should just get a model with approval for road traffic, because not all motorized scooters are permitted to ride on the road. As mentioned above, it should be a small street legal scooter with a front and a rear light. It also has a rear view mirror and handbrake on each side of the steering wheel and side reflectors, and a bell, also. Without these accessories, it is not a legal electric scooter for riding on the street.</p>
<p>When buying an electric scooter, certainly the seller can prove that the electric scooter is approved for road traffic. On the internet, in supermarkets or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea_market" rel="nofollow">flea markets</a>, you can find from 100 euros, but you can buy it often blindly, so I do not know if you can go on the street. Go rather to a genuine local distributor and can prove everything and explain, even if you pay a lot more there.</p>
<p>If you are caught with an electric scooter with no admission for road traffic, you have to pay a big sum of money and make points even on your license. The same applies if you do not have the necessary license. For the motorized scooter, you need at least a moped certificate (can be deposited from the age of 15 years). Of course, going every other licenses that give you the right to drive a moped.</p>
<p>Electric scooter needs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_license" rel="nofollow">business license </a>and liability insurance as a moped. In addition, a suitable license drive is required. The insurance must be affixed to the rear cylinder. If these are not available, the vehicle is moved in a control immediately. If the owner of the vehicle causes accident, he must also pay for the damage completely.</p>
<p>A helmet is mandatory, but only if the electric scooters can be faster than 20 km / h. However, the lighting requirements (same or not) to be switched on each trip. Check in advance with the new rules motorized scooters before purchasing.</p>
<p>If you comply with all laws, you will surely have lots of fun with the little scooter. Therefore, a purchase should never be made without research.</p>

                        <p>So you&#8217;ve recently taken on mountain biking, after recommendations from friends and family, and after serious consideration brought about by what you&#8217;ve probably been watching on TV. Something about riding a bike across terrains unknown and otherwise breathtakingly beautiful gives you a sense of longing, a sense of wanting to be free from the everyday grind.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve consulted with your expert buddies who have had the hobby for years ahead of you, and now you&#8217;ve gone to the point where you&#8217;ve bought a <a href="http://www.recreationspace.com/best-mountain-bikes-under-500/" target="_blank">best mountain bikes under 500</a> USD for yourself. You&#8217;ve taken it out for a spin, and so far, in the first trails and paths you&#8217;ve taken, you&#8217;ve been very satisfied.</p>
<p>If you have a small budget, see this guide to choose a <a href="http://www.recreationspace.com/best-mountain-bike-under-300/" target="_blank">best mountain bike under 300</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to climbing steeper trails, you&#8217;re finding yourself wanting, particularly when you see others going ahead of you. Far ahead of you.</p>
<p>Does this sound familiar? Do not fret. While climbing with your mountain bike is not a skill instantly mastered, it will definitely factor in most, if not all of the trails you will be riding through, no matter what skill level you place yourself in. In other words, it helps to improve your climbing game, and it helps to improve it <em>yesterday</em>.</p>
<p>Somewhere in this and other similar articles, you&#8217;re bound to hear the words that practice makes perfect. While there are a lot of factors to climbing with a mountain bike that involve practice, practice, and more practice, here are some tips you ought to try to immediately improve your climbing:</p>
<h2>Prioritize Proper Preparations</h2>
<p>The chances of the most efficient and effective biking trip increase with taking the right precautions. Check yourself and your bike with the same mindset you would have when you check your car before taking a long trip. Read some helpful tips at RecreationSpace.com to know what&#8217;s in a mountain biker&#8217;s survival kit.<img class="alignleft" src="http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/stelprdb5253881.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="262" /></p>
<p>While you check gas and oil among other things in a car, you would do well to <strong>check air and water</strong> before you go on a biking excursion. This means you would check the air on your tires, so you have the right pressure to handle the terrain, whether you are on an incline or a flat path.</p>
<p>Checking water? Your bike stays dry; it&#8217;s you who needs to hydrate. Don&#8217;t make the mistake of drinking only when you feel like it, especially during more physical activities where you know you&#8217;ll be sweating buckets in a short period of time. Have a good drink of water around 10-20 minutes before you even set off, and you should be all set. <a href="http://www.prospects-fp7.eu/2015/12/14/how-to-climb-better-on-a-mountain-bike/#more-76" class="more-link">Continue reading <i class="icon-arrow-right"></i></a></p>

                        <p>Remove stains and pet hair on seat covers, make shine to plastic discolored surfaces and fight against bad smells &#8230; Here are some simple, practical and economical solutions to restore the luster to the interior of your vehicle.</p>
<h3><strong>Maintain carpet and floor mats</strong></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://automotivewatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/carpet-floor-mats-for-car.jpg" alt="" width="421" height="434" /></p>
<p>Carpets tend to deteriorate rapidly, especially in the driver&#8217;s seat. It is very important to ensure their maintenance: in fact, a carpet that let through moisture will accelerate the corrosion of the floor.<br />
Practice Tip: Quick and efficient, baking soda is recommended to deodorize the seats and carpet. Leave it for 15 minutes or longer in case of persistent odors. Next, vacuuming your carpets with <a href="http://www.zentiz.com/top-10-best-car-vacuum-cleaner-reviews/">best car vacuum</a>!</p>
<h3>Wash laminated surfaces</h3>
<p>Use a sponge, combined with a detergent or dishwashing liquid to clean the plastic laminated surfaces in your vehicle.<br />
Better to start at the bottom of the doors, usually the dirtiest because of climbs and descents.<br />
For sensitive surfaces such as electronic equipment and meters, use a simple cloth is enough.<br />
For doors and dashboard, a damp microfiber is ideal since it removes much dust between the windshield and the board. For the air vents, a toothbrush is sometimes necessary for these difficult to access.<br />
To complete the cleaning, it is advisable to rinse with a well wrung sponge, and wipe with a lint-free soft cloth or chamois.<br />
Practical Tip: A clean cloth slightly dampened with fabric softener helps give a glow to the dashboard and laminated surfaces!</p>

<p>Waffles are among your favorite food but sometimes they turn out to be disappointing. Does that sound familiar?</p>

<p>When you brought your iron you were convinced it was the <a href="http://wafflemakerstore.com/" target="_blank">best waffle maker</a>, but tasteless waffles demonstrate that something has gone wrong. Yet do not put the waffle in the trash, or stop making waffles for breakfast.<em> Instead try some of these waffle recipes and waffle making tips to restore your confidence in your waffle iron and your own ability.</em></p>
<h3>TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT</h3>
<p>If the previously trusted combination of waffle recipes, trusted recipes, and your ability are not working try something different.</p>
<p>There is very little difference between a tasteless waffle and a great one, save for changing the recipes and using better techniques.</p>
<h4>Make better batter</h4>
<p>Getting the batter mixture right for your waffles is a key part of achieving great tasting waffles. <a href="http://www.prospects-fp7.eu/2015/10/10/how-to-get-great-waffles/#more-110" class="more-link">Continue reading <i class="icon-arrow-right"></i></a></p>

                        <p>It was a very hot and humid Saturday morning, as I had one foot clipped into my mountain bike, while waiting patiently with about thirty other riders at the startup line for a 15-mile mountain bike race. As I sat there, I looked over at the other competitors, and did notice that some of them did have a ball of fire within their eyes and others had very ripped leg muscles. They were all sitting on their bikes, some of them had carbon fiber bikes, while others had hard tail and full suspension choice bikes. There was even a few 29ers as well. Here, was me, I only had one year of experience.</p>
<p><img id="__wp-temp-img-id" class="aligncenter" title="" src="http://www.ambwallpapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mountain_biking_hd_widescreen_wallpapers_1920x1200.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1200" /></p>
<p>This one year of experience was riding on single track trails with my Trek full suspension mountain bike. I was doing my very best to stay pumped up. This was probably going to be a very grueling bike race. Right before the gunshot was heard, I was keeping my hands totally relaxed on the handle bar grips, and did only let go long enough to make sure that my gloves were on tight enough. I also needed to make sure my helmet was adjusted properly. I take a few sips out from the <a href="http://www.camelbak.com/en/International/Sports-Recreation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Camelbak hydration system</a> that was strapped to my person. When the gunshot finally went off and was heard all across the mountain bike park.</p>
<p>We all were suddenly caught up in a very mad dash to get away from the starting line and make our way from the open field towards the single track trails. While in the process of changing gears, I gazed across at the other riders in front of me, and did wonder what I would personally encounter in this bike race. A thought suddenly did go flashing through the back of my mind.</p>
<h2><strong>What are the best mountain bikes under 1000 overall?</strong></h2>
<p><img id="__wp-temp-img-id" class="aligncenter" title="" src="http://www.bike198.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Emmanual-Scott-Scale-SL-super-lightweight-mountain-bike9.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="397" /></p>
<p>The answer to this question is one that should be researched personally. There are lots of awesome <a href="http://empiremountainbikes.com/" target="_blank">best mountain bikes under 1000</a> on the market. A person just needs to know how to look for them personally. The thought that did come to the back of my mind was all about this. I thought about what would lead me up to buying a mountain bike.</p>
<p>How long would it take me before I finally did feel confident about daring to ride a bike through rugged terrain? The very same could be said about switchback trails and very steep hills. Would this new sport be able to help me out in other key endurance sports that I did compete in? I had to wait to find out what the answers would be for me. <a href="http://www.prospects-fp7.eu/2015/10/10/what-are-some-of-the-best-mountain-bikes-under-1000-to-chose-from/#more-108" class="more-link">Continue reading <i class="icon-arrow-right"></i></a></p>

                        <p>One of the oldest technologies that humans have been using is called as food preservation. Though there are lot many people who strongly disagree about different methods of food preservation and which is the best method but all have one common goal in mind and that is to have fresh and wholesome food. The best part about preserving the food is that you can store your food for a long period of time and re-use it again with all the nutritional value intact. These days the <strong><a href="http://www.pressurecookerportal.com/">best pressure cooker</a></strong> is used for preserving food but still there are many old techniques which are being put into use.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-64 size-medium" src="http://www.prospects-fp7.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/best-pressure-cooker-for-canning-300x195.jpg" alt="best pressure cooker for canning" width="300" height="195" /></p>
<p>Apart from retaining its nutritional value, preserved food is safe and is free from naturally occurring toxins, harmful chemicals and pathogenic microorganisms. You can easily make food bacteria free by sterilizing it. Take for example; if milk is not sterilized then the naturally occurring bacteria can spoil the milk in three to four hours if it is left in open at room temperature. If put the same milk into a refrigerator then the bacteria growth slows down and the milk can be kept in a good condition for even few weeks.</p>
<h3>What does food preservation involves?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The process of food preservation involves treating of food with special elements. This treated food is then handled in such a manner that it stays fresh for a long period of time.</li>
<li>Take for example, during ancient times, Egyptian people use to treat cheese with salt and then this cheese was stored in lime induced clothes. This helped them to use cheese for a long period of time. This is just one simple technique shared with you, but there are thousands of food preservation techniques that are available and many of them are still being deployed by humans.</li>

                        <p>Do you have any plan for this vacation. If you are type of person who want to be in nature, you definitely love the idea of camping trip. It is also an exciting experience for your children (if you have). However, before a camping trip, there seems to have a lot of things to prepared. Firstly, the tent. If you intend to have a trip of 4 people, better choose a <a href="http://www.familytentcenter.com/" target="_blank">best 6 person tent</a>, hence you will have more space to accomodate other equiments. Then, you need to study other information of the tent such as how to pitch up, its features, etc. In this article, you will be provided information about types of poles, prevention of breaks, fix.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://media.backpacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/poles_445x260.jpg" alt="" width="445" height="260" /></p>
<h2>Types of poles, prevention of breaks, fix</h2>
<p>Studs poles are key elements in the tent, since the sustain and maintain the shape. In theory we all want are poles that are light (and thus lower the total weight of the tent), resistant to breakage, resilient to strong winds (ie that bend without breaking and maintaining the shape of the tent) and cheap &#8230; well, the bad news is that there is something to meet all these requirements simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Duralumin poles:</h3>
<p>As close to the ideal written above are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duralumin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Duralumin </a>poles. These rods are all of the above except for the fact that these rods are more expensive than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">fiberglass </a>and therefore generally see only in models tent high end, usually in the tents of high mountain, made with materials excellent quality where no matter the cost but the performance against inclement weather. Moreover, in extremely cold environments are the aluminum poles are the only option because the fiberglass may become brittle and break easily.</p>
<p>Other advantages are that they are easier to repair in the field while camping (you would need a repair kit) and also, the life of these poles is much longer than the fiberglass.</p>
<p>In short, if money is no problem and you have a tent with fiberglass poles, you can buy a set of aluminum and replace.</p>
<h3>Fiberglass poles:</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.snowys.com.au/images/product-images/21601-1.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="351" /></p>
<p>They are most common in our market models igloos 3 stations (which are the most used) use these poles, that is, are those that use the most campers and therefore it is necessary to know its characteristics &#8230;</p>
<p>Advantages: they are light for transportation, are flexible and have the necessary resistance to normal weather conditions, wind and rain. They are inexpensive, allowing us to buy extra poles and bring replacement in case we break some camping.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: have a much shorter than the aluminum life, are difficult to repair (often breaks such a way that it is no longer possible), extreme cold or wind can break easily.</p>
<h2>To minimize the chances of failure can take these precautions:</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.bigagnes.com/resources/products/flycreekUL1tent-zm.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="742" /></p>
<h3>a) Adequate pole diameter:</h3>
<p>Do not use poles with a diameter less than 8 mm (because they will not hold up well wind). If the tent is less than 150 cm using poles with diameters between 8.3 mm and 9.5 mm. If the tent is between 150 cm and 200 cm poles using 9.5 mm and 11 mm. If the tent is more than 2 meters using larger diameters. (These values are averages, keep in mind that not all poles fiberglass have the same quality and that affects your strength and flexibility, but the quality of the workmanship and materials of the pole is not something you can see with the naked eye. Again, the key here is to trust serious brands of tents and not rely heavily on cheap tents)</p>
<h3>b) Another key point is the intersection of studs on the roof of the tent.</h3>
<p>In models where there are two studs intersecting perpendicularly (i.e. 90 °) studs can be attached in two ways: with adjusting straps that are attached by a cross and where the two studs are embedded. The latter is ideal if we can implement it, because in case of strong winds force is distributed over the two studs distributed more evenly which reduces the possibility that the pole breaks (while the tent better retains its shape without disturbing people who are inside)</p>
<h3>c) In assembling the tent, make sure that the poles are properly hooked to each other and the studs securely fastened with hooks or fasteners have the tent.</h3>
<p>In short, fiberglass poles are a good choice for holidays in camping tents 3 seasons but is highly recommendable to buy spare ribs (especially if we have some possibilities zone of strong winds)</p>

                        <p>There are common questions that need to be answered when buying an Ar-15 scope and of course those who are trying to sell their product will tell you should get theirs. Knowing what your need and defining the questions that you had will help you choose the best one you can get.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How to find the best Ar-15 scope</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/243_WSSM_Olympic_Arms_AR15.jpg" alt="" width="586" height="440" /></p>
<h3><strong>Price</strong></h3>
<p>The more expensive ones are usually the better ones because they cost more for a reason. The quality and durability is what you need so you must not go cheap when getting a scope. They also come with better optics.</p>
<h3><strong>Go for larger objective lens</strong></h3>
<p>When you have a bigger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_(optics)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">objective lens</a>, it will gather more light so you can see your target more clearly. This would be perfect under low light conditions and it will matter a lot if you are specifically targeting something. Even if bigger lenses are heavier, they will give you a better view.</p>
<h3><strong>Larger tube</strong></h3>
<p>If the tube is larger, it will give you more light transmission and it also enables you to do more adjustments to get more elevation and windage. A bigger tube weighs more and the  cross-section is 39% heavier which makes the overall weight 39% heavier.</p>
<h3><strong>Get a scope that is appropriate for your ammo</strong></h3>
<p>The scope that you get should be right for the maximum distance that you will be shooting. Buying a scope will add weight, size, and cost so only scopes that you will really need.</p>
<h3><strong>Magnification</strong></h3>
<p>If you need one that lets you see a target that is farther away, you should get one with higher magnification. It will cost more, but you will be able to see a target better and have a better aim. <a href="http://www.prospects-fp7.eu/2015/11/17/how-to-find-the-best-ar-15-scope/#more-131" class="more-link">Continue reading <i class="icon-arrow-right"></i></a></p>

                        <p>Don&#8217;t toss back those painkillers like candy. Sports medicine experts recommend NSAIDs be used selectively and with caution. Keep these general tips in mind.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/JJInjury.jpg" alt="" width="561" height="421" /></p>
<h3>* TRY ICE BEFORE DRUGS</h3>
<p>If applied before an injury has a chance to swell significantly, ice often works faster and provides more pain relief than medication. Ice helps drown out signals from the pain-carrying fibers, reduces local blood flow to minimize swelling and chills nerves below their normal operating temperature. Apply ice every two hours for 20 minutes as long as the injury hurts.</p>
<h3>* CONSIDER TAKING A BREAK</h3>
<p>Dr. Rizzo recommends asking yourself two questions before deciding to work through the pain. First, is the pain causing you to change your mechanics? If so, reduce your intensity, frequency and distance for a few weeks to let the injury heal or temporarily switch to another form of exercise.</p>
<p>Second, how long does the pain persist after a workout? It should return to a manageable baseline within two hours, especially if you use ice and NSAIDs. If it persists longer, odds are that continued workouts will damage soft tissues.</p>
<h3>* TAKE ONLY AS DIRECTED</h3>
<p>Never consume more than the maximum daily dosage indicated on the label unless advised to do so by your doctor.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get impatient: The pain may be zapped with a single dose, but Rizzo warns that it may take up to five doses before the anti-inflammatory effects kick in. And always check with your doctor if you&#8217;re pregnant or nursing. <a href="http://www.prospects-fp7.eu/2015/11/14/keep-healthy/#more-127" class="more-link">Continue reading <i class="icon-arrow-right"></i></a></p>

                        <p>Spending on a good metal detector is worth the price especially if you are in a place that has a community for you to protect and several guards to equip. If you compromise on the quality of your security equipment, you could also be putting the lives of people in danger. One of the best metal detectors out there is the one by Rapiscan systems. They have been making metal detectors for 40 years and it is still a growing company today. Their metal detectors can be for indoor and outdoor use making it suitable for almost any security situation.</p>
<h2>Best metal detector for security</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Metal_Detector.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="490" /></p>
<h3>Metor 150</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_detector" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">metal detector</a> has a detection field that is uniformed and it gives a complete detection without depending on the orientation of an object so it is very sensitive and efficient. The control unit is friendly and it is integrated into the cross piece allowing better execution and function.</p>
<p>An access code is needed to operate the metal detector therefore preventing just anyone to play or change the settings. This is important because only the security should know this code and be able to access the metal detector. It is not only easy to set-up, but it is highly sensitive as well.</p>
<p>This metal detector is active all throughout and will be able to detect threat at all times.</p>
<h3>Metor 6M</h3>
<p>This is primarily used for detecting weapons and it is multi-purpose. Mostly used in airports, seaports, prisons, federal houses, and court rooms. This one already screens a person entirely as they walk through metal detector. It can work even in high traffic situations and crowded areas. <a href="http://www.prospects-fp7.eu/2015/11/09/best-metal-detector-for-security/#more-129" class="more-link">Continue reading <i class="icon-arrow-right"></i></a></p>

                        <p>The pain pathway. To understand why NSAIDs have gained such popularity among ache-prone athletes, consider the biochemical basis of sports pain. Whether you hurt because of an acutely twisted ankle or shoulder tendons worn raw by too many tennis serves, pain is triggered in essentially the same fashion.</p>
<p>Trauma to muscles and connective tissues ruptures cell membranes, allowing the cells&#8217; molecules to leak into the surrounding fluids, explains J. David Haddox, D.D.S., M.D., former president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine. These chemicals, in turn, are broken down by enzymes into what has been nicknamed &#8220;inflammatory soup&#8221;&#8211;a bouillabaisse of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, histamine, bradykinin and other elements that stimulate swelling, increase blood flow and trigger the onslaught of white blood cells, which your body uses to clean up and rebuild injured tissue.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Berlin_marathon.jpg" alt="" width="419" height="303" /></p>
<p>Though all these biomolecules play a role in the perception of pain, inflammatory prostaglandins are particularly active. NSAIDs work, in large part, by kiboshing the production of prostaglandins in the first place. Fewer prostaglandins means less inflammation as well as fewer &#8220;ouch&#8221; signals that ultimately make their way to the brain.</p>
<p>Okay, so you feel better&#8211;but do these medicines help you get better? Definitely not, says Gabe Mirkin, M.D., a sports medicine expert at Georgetown University&#8217;s School of Medicine. Inflammation, he argues, is an integral part of the body&#8217;s healing process, and we hinder it at our own peril. &#8220;There&#8217;s no evidence that NSAIDs hasten healing,&#8221; Mirkin says. &#8220;Whenever you try to change nature, you lose something. I think you&#8217;re usually better off taking nothing.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Others preach a more moderate line</h2>
<p>&#8220;I think that nature&#8217;s inflammatory response is sometimes too strong,&#8221; the Mayo Clinic&#8217;s Rizzo says. &#8220;When you get too much inflammation and swelling, it can impede range of motion, which can delay healing. Our goal is not to eliminate the body&#8217;s inflammatory response but to modify it.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>Masters figure-skating champion and orthopedic surgeon Angela Smith, M.D., recalls a world-class competitor who developed &#8220;boot-top tendinitis&#8221;&#8211;a painful inflammation midway up her shin. &#8220;It was an Olympic year, and she felt she had to continue training,&#8221; Smith recalls.</p>
<p>So for several weeks, the young woman took relatively modest daily doses of NSAIDs while pushing herself on the ice. During one of the skater&#8217;s checkups, Smith found that the pain had shifted to another part of her leg and gotten much worse. X rays showed the telltale fuzz of new bone being laid down&#8211;the radiographic signature of a stress fracture. &#8220;Her pain had been blunted enough by the medicine,&#8221; Smith says, &#8220;that she was able to do herself a lot more harm.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Less pain, less gain?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Canoe-kayak-marathon.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" /></p>
<p>Such cautionary episodes are hardly uncommon. Dave Jenkinson, head team physician for the USA Canoe/Kayak team, has seen dozens of cases of elite and recreational paddlers alike start out with low-level, chronic tendinitis and, thanks to handfuls of pain relievers, exercise their way into major shoulder problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of athletes rely on these drugs as a kind of `stretch in a bottle,'&#8221; Jenkinson says. &#8220;You show up for a weekend workout with no time to spare for general conditioning and appropriate warm-up. So you pop a couple of pills instead of stretching. That&#8217;s not the way these drugs are meant to be used. They can be helpful medicines, but they are not a replacement for common sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical giant Merck &amp; Co. estimates that 13 million Americans regularly take over-the-counter NSAIDs. Of these, some 76,000 are hospitalized annually with bleeding ulcers&#8211;and 7,600 end up dying from them. When it comes to athletes, no exact statistics exist on how common NSAID abuse is, but talk to any sports medicine practitioner (or, for that matter, any committed athlete), and you&#8217;re likely to get an earful of war stories.</p>
<p>Since 1984, when the Food and Drug Administration first approved ibuprofen for sale without a prescription, the over-the-counter market for NSAIDs has grown into a $3-billion-a-year industry. Fields estimates that 75 percent of his athletic patients regularly use these over-the-counter drugs, and they don&#8217;t always do so wisely.</p>
