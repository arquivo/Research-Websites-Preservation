<section class="article-content">

	<p>To shed weight we&#8217;re motivated to consume less. But have you considered if this is delivered to the extreme? &#8220;Starvation,&#8221; or severe food restriction with extremely low calorie levels, actually impedes weight loss. Though it seems contradictory, starving your body of food might make weight goals harder to accomplish.</p>
<p>Less Isn&#8217;t More</p>
<p>Not eating enough can slow the body&#8217;s metabolism, rendering it harder to lose excess weight. The entire body can detect when there&#8217;s been a change in calorie levels and reacts accordingly. With severe food restriction, our bodies starts to conserve its fuel, stored fat. The results is basically that you burn less calories and prevent slimming down. Then regardless if you are exercising, working or sleeping, you may burn fewer calories throughout the day. While &#8220;dieting&#8221; should really mean deprivation and hunger, staying fed actually results in more productive weight loss and maintenance.</p>
<p>The Body&#8217;s Protective Mechanism</p>
<p>This metabolic a reaction to starvation demonstrates a protective mechanism of survival. Whenever you don&#8217;t eat, our bodies thinks you will be entering a time period of famine. That knows as soon as the next food may appear along, so that the body conserves its stored calories for later use. This evolutionary protection of the ancestors makes an &#8220;all or nothing&#8221; eating pattern ineffective for weight loss. Though sustained starvation across a long time will in the end end in weight loss, this may not be a beautiful or realistic weight-loss plan. Weight loss from starvation could cause lasting problems for your system and metabolism.</p>
<p>Restriction Drops Serotonin</p>
<p>Besides a drop in metabolism, a starvation diet also results in a drop in serotonin. This neurotransmitter produces the calm, peaceful and satisfied feeling. When serotonin levels get too low, people feel more agitated and cranky. When attempting to switch habits, this agitated state causes it to be more difficult to reach your goals and remain motivated. This leaves dieters more prone to splurge on extra treats and fall &#8220;over wagon&#8221; of healthy eating trying to find some joy and relief. Eating, especially carbohydrates, supports an even more consistent serotonin level as well as the emotional strength to keep on track.</p>
<p>To Lose Weight Naturally You Will Need To EAT</p>
<p>Eat to burn fat? It&#8217;s a change in perception that has to select successful long term weight loss. Dr. Laura Pawlak has evaluated the existing science of weight loss and concludes, &#8220;A large and growing body of studies suggest that the most efficient method of gradual and permanent weight loss is actually a food plan with numerous grain, vegetables, legumes, fruits as well as a moderate consumption of good fats.&#8221; In their own book &#8220;Stop Weight Gain,&#8221;, Pawlak suggests eating eat five or six times on a daily basis with many foods from plants and high in protein. Avoid dehydration with a lot of water, and eat slowly permit your whole body realize it&#8217;s full before you&#8217;ve gone overboard with extra helpings.</p>
<p>All In Balance</p>
<p>For your average dieter, periods of starvation ends in &#8220;yo-yo&#8221; dieting cycles in addition to a higher average weight as time pass. &#8220;If exercises are joined with the lowest-fat, high-fiber food plan, generally more calories are burned than replenished,&#8221; Pawlak says. Have a healthy balance of eating fewer calories than normal coupled with frequent exercise to determine results. If you believe hungry, eat some high-fiber, low-calorie food that could keep metabolism running strong. Never drop below one thousand calories every day. Exercise will supercharge your metabolic burn, assisting you burn those excess weight. But starvation is rarely the important thing to successful weight changes in the long run.</p>
