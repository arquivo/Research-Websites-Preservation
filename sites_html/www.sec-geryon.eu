<p><strong>Project Overview</strong><br />
</p>
<p>In the current digital world, users of first responder communication systems are aware of the benefits that the interconnection between different Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) and the integration of new advanced data services could bring to their professional sectors. Considering the current multimedia capabilities of both emergency and general purpose mobile terminals, it is just a matter of time that we see police or fire-fighter units transmitting image-based vital information in real time to central stations or to other mobile units in order to assure quick and expert responses to critical incidents. In order to satisfy this need for broadband data services, different PMR technologies have tried to improve data transmission capabilities. Unfortunately, however, interoperability between systems is largely based upon bespoke interfaces between specific systems.</p>
	  <p>GERYON will provide an unified answer to the problems that system integrators must face when interconnecting different emergency networks by bringing together and deploying in a specialised manner the common technical and operational logic regarding Identity Management, Security, Signalling, Transcoding and enhanced emergency services deployment. Instead of duplicating the same functionality in different gateways for each pair of technologies to be connected, GERYON will extract and unify the related management modules in a technology independent way and will provide mechanisms and interfaces for an easy deployment of new technology dependent interconnection gateways.</p>
