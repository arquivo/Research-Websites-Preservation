  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  The production of new micro/nanoporous membranes, which can be functionalised, is in rapid development and have shown a high potential in a wide range of industrial applications. The immobilization of biomolecules serving as biocatalysts or as a component of sensors into organised structures presents many advantages in terms of cost reduction, high-throughput sample processing, integration, and automation. Bioactive molecules can be oriented onto a nanostructured surface or encased in an inorganic matrix. This proposal aims to develop novel functionalised inorganic-organic membranes, with selective and defined physico-chemical properties, which can be used as nanosieves, as a component of integrated analytical systems, in food processing, drug discovery and diagnostic applications. Bioactive molecules such as enzymes and antibodies, immobilized within the inorganic-organic hybrid architecture of the membrane, maintain their biological activity and are more stable, and/or are only accessible for a selected (size) range of substrates compared to their freely soluble counterparts. The manufacture of nanoporous membranes reinforced by an inorganic skeleton and combined with bioactive biomolecules is a highly innovative field. Here we propose the combination of two parallel approaches for the formation of functional inorganic-organic membranes. The first one regards the formation of a single-layered structure derived from bacteria and archaea, named S-layer, in which the self-assembling property of the subunits into a porous “paracrystalline” structure can be exploited as a template on which other molecules, such as silicateins, can bind. The second approach regards the encapsulation of biomolecules into the porous silica glass formed either biocatalytically (via silicateins, a special group of enzymes catalyzing the formation of inorganic metal oxides) or by sol-gel process. While the first approach is completely biological, being the S-layer derived from living organisms, the second one results in an inorganic-organic hybrid composition of the membrane, in which organic molecules can be encapsulated. Both nanobiotechnology approaches are inspired by molecular biology and are based on processes of self-organisation at mild environmental conditions. The newly developed technique will be exploited in microfluidics based sample processing and micro-array development, in industrial nanosieves, as well as in sensors in drinking water systems.<br>
