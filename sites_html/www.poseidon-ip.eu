<div class="welcome"> Welcome to POSE&sup2;IDON </div>
<p>The POSE&sup2;IDON consortium existing of 30 companies - 14 industrial companies,
	4 shipyards, 6 universities or research institutes, 3 professional associations
	or consulting companies and 3 classification societies - is to investigate
	the potential for the commercially effective application of electric ship technology
	in an about Euro 20 million European Union funded project.</p>
<p>The project POSE&sup2;IDON - Power Optimised Ship for Environment with Electric
	Innovative Designs ON board -, which began in January 2009, consists to provide
	a working guide on how to improve efficiency and reduce the environmental impact
	of the combined European commercial shipping fleet and to enhance the electric
	ship concept so that it can be applied to a wider range of vessels than is
	currently the case.</p>
<p>The principal barrier to adoption of the electric ship concept in smaller
	merchant ships is the size of the generating equipment and propulsion motor.
	The Pose&sup2;idon consortium is then focusing on achieving size reduction
	through the development of new technologies across all aspects of marine electrical
	engineering. A key element of this will be the application of High Temperature
	Superconductivity (HTS) technology that will allow for smaller principal electrical
	components and an increase in efficiency. Additionally, electric auxiliaries,
	wireless technology and fail safe power distribution will be studied.</p>

	life cycle assessment model to facilitate ship ecodesign", Proceedings of the 
	Annual Conference of the European Safety and Reliability Association (ESREL 
	2011), Troyes, France, 18-22 September, pp. 2870-2879.</h2>
<p>Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has recently gained widespread support as a way of 
	estimating the environmental and societal impact over the lifetime of a ship. 
	The output will normally be a set of indicators, but there is an increasing 
	demand for including other indicators related to safety and economics. An 
	integrated analysis demands that all indicators are weighted with respect to 
	their relative importance in a multi-criteria decision process. However, 
	comparison will not be efficient without a common denominator. In order to 
	facilitate integration of ecodesign (design process to environmentally optimize
	the design) with risk based design (ship design optimized with regards to 
	safety and accidental costs), this paper proposes a way of monetizing the 
	various indicators related to the environmental footprint, the social external 
	impact and safety. Hence, an integrated model for assessing the safety and 
	environmental performance of a ship in monetary terms is presented in this paper.</p>
