Yet, because of multiple security threats that weigh on its internal dynamics, the region appears particularly vulnerable and politically unstable. Aside from the security context, the countries&rsquo; uneven economic performance has contributed to destabilising trends in the region as well. As a global actor wishing to ensure both its own security and international stability, the EU is particularly well equipped to intervene effectively in the region. However, the EU&rsquo;s approach has for years lacked an overall strategy for its engagements in the region, instead being largely empirical and pragmatic in nature. The multiple dimensions of this relationship provide information on trends in the EU&rsquo;s strategy towards the region and its reactions to threats that pass through the area, including coordination with other stakeholders in the broader Atlantic area.<\/p>","views":"13","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":false,"type":"0","created":"2016-01-20 18:34:00","modified":"2016-02-03 16:21:14"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"197","content_id":"1796","type":"1","file_name":"1796-The Relations between the European Union and Africa.pdf","description":"The Relations between European Union and Africa","created":"2016-01-20 18:35:14","modified":"2016-01-20 18:35:14"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"7481","content_id":"1796","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"7480","content_id":"1796","tag_id":"150","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"7481","content_id":"1796","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1793","code":"a-pan-atlantic-agenda-for-eu-us-relations","user_id":"1","title":"A PAN-ATLANTIC AGENDA FOR EU-US RELATIONS","abstract":"Atlantic Future Policy Paper No. 1: &ldquo;A Pan-Atlantic Agenda for EU-US Relations&rdquo; written by Daniel S.

Third, the EU and the US must also engage ''Asian Hemisphere'' countries on ''Atlantic Hemisphere'' issues as Asia pivots to the Atlantic.<\/p>","views":"10","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":false,"type":"0","created":"2016-01-19 18:55:00","modified":"2016-02-04 12:35:26"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"195","content_id":"1793","type":"1","file_name":"1793-A Pan-Atlantic Agenda for EU-US Relations.pdf","description":"A Pan-Atlantic Agenda for EU-US relations","created":"2016-01-19 18:59:55","modified":"2016-01-19 18:59:55"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"7493","content_id":"1793","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"7492","content_id":"1793","tag_id":"150","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"7493","content_id":"1793","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1792","code":"charting-the-future-of-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"CHARTING THE FUTURE OF THE ATLANTIC","abstract":"Atlantic Future Policy Report No. 1: &ldquo;Charting the future of the Atlantic&rdquo; by Susanne Gratius and Giovanni Grevi from FRIDE, Alfredo Vallad&atilde;o (HEM-CESEM) and Bernardo Venturi (IAI)","body":"<p>The Atlantic Space harbours many contradictions, which invites caution when seeking to charter the future of the Atlantic over the next ten years. This paper reviews large clusters of trends, factors and actors, their potential developments and the implications for the future of cooperation or competition and political convergence or divergence in the Atlantic. A range of factors points to deepening trade and investment ties in this vast region, as a new &lsquo;industrial revolution&rsquo; is emerging there. Demographic prospects reveal divergent trends in Africa, where the population is growing fast, and Europe, where the population will continue to grow older. The middle classes in the South Atlantic will be expanding whereas those in the North are under socio-economic stress, even if North-South income differentials will remain very large. Amidst broadly shared democratic values, normative differences appear an enduring feature of the Atlantic Space. Rising populism in Europe might affect prospects for cooperation with Europe&rsquo;s partners in the Atlantic and beyond. Cooperation within the Atlantic Space is expected to make progress through flexible and targeted formats in areas such as security, energy and the environment, among others. Whether the TTIP will be concluded, and how inclusive it will be of other Atlantic partners, will be important factors for the future of the Atlantic.<\/p>","views":"12","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":false,"type":"0","created":"2016-01-19 18:23:00","modified":"2016-02-06 15:23:17"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"194","content_id":"1792","type":"1","file_name":"1792-Charting the future of the Atlantic.pdf","description":"Charting the Future of the Atlantic","created":"2016-01-19 18:24:24","modified":"2016-01-19 18:24:24"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"7465","content_id":"1792","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"7464","content_id":"1792","tag_id":"150","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"7465","content_id":"1792","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1791","code":"interregionalism-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"INTERREGIONALISM IN THE ATLANTIC","abstract":"Atlantic Future Scientific paper no. 38 : &ldquo;Debunking Interregionalism: Concepts, Types and Critique &ndash; With a Transatlantic Focus&rdquo;, by Gian Luca Gardini (University Erlangen-N&uuml;rnberg, Germany) and Andr&eacute;s Malamud (IPRI and University of Lisbon, Portugal) is available","body":"<p>Interregionalism means region-to-region relations.

This is probably, <br \/>at least in part, because this enormous geopolitical area &ndash; including <br \/>countries from North America, Central America, Europe as well as littoral <br \/>countries in South America and Africa - is very eclectic. However, the vast <br \/>majority of the countries that form the Atlantic basin are democracies, and <br \/>collectively they account for the majority of global trade and foreign <br \/>investment as well as a very large and growing proportion of energy <br \/>resources. In addition, the absence of entrenched rivalry among the main <br \/>powers of the Atlantic Basin is notable compared to the hardening <br \/>geopolitics of other regions. This FRIDE working paper highlights some of <br \/>the principal dimensions of interdependence within the Atlantic Basin - such <br \/>as trade, investment and energy - as well as the main political and security <br \/>trends therein. It shows that intra-Atlantic links and common challenges are <br \/>growing, but also that connections between Atlantic countries and Asia, <br \/>notably China, are fast expanding. On that basis, the paper assesses the <br \/>prospects for future cooperation across this massive maritime space.<\/p>","views":"154","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":false,"type":"0","created":"2015-12-03 13:54:00","modified":"2016-02-08 05:31:08"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"184","content_id":"1601","type":"1","file_name":"1601-The Atlantic Basin.

Failure to unite all regions bordering the Atlantic into a common view, the scepticism in South Atlantic countries about the very idea of the Atlantic space, the lack of efficient management of common and scarce resources, the food imbalances found in the Atlantic and the issues that come with state fragility are analysed here as some of the main obstacles to the emergence of a true Atlantic space based on cooperation and opportunities for all the regions.

While North-South and South-South links are growing, they are influenced by the presence of external factors, like China or the price of commodities. There is strong evidence of continued and lasting economic interaction among the developed Atlantic in the north, and there does appear to be some trend toward the integration of Africa and Latin America into the Atlantic (and global) trade and investment regimes, through their northern partners, partly because of the rise of emerging market economies (especially Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa) and partly because of decisions to increase South-South economic interactions.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Fossil Fuel and Renewable Energy Industries<\/em> explains that although, the Atlantic Space holds a large share of the world&rsquo;s unexploited fossil fuel reserves, including 40% of oil reserves, 20% of natural gas reserves, and roughly 40% of coal reserves (BP 2015), the future of the industry is uncertain. Large profit margins (in the past) and continued subsides have made some of these unconventional and difficult hydrocarbon reserves easier to access via new technologies, particularly in the cases of the North Atlantic shale revolution and the Southern Atlantic &ldquo;oil ring&rdquo; ( Isbell 2014). In the North Atlantic, shale gas now accounts for more than 35% of American gas production, compared to 2% in 2000. Demand for shale oil and gas is predicted to rise from 1.96 BCM\/day to 2.69 BCM\/day by 2035 (Szalai 2013). In the Southern Atlantic oil ring, deep-water offshore oil rigs now span from Namibia and Morocco in the east to Argentina and the Gulf of Mexico (Isbell 2014), but their further expansion is in doubt given current and projected oil prices.<\/p>","views":"378","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-12-03 12:16:00","modified":"2016-02-08 11:52:48"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"182","content_id":"1599","type":"1","file_name":"1599-Economic and financial links in the Atlantic Space.pdf","description":"Economic and financial links in the Atlantic Space","created":"2015-12-03 12:42:22","modified":"2015-12-03 12:42:22"},{"id":"183","content_id":"1599","type":"1","file_name":"1599-Outlook for the fossil fuel and renewable energy industries in the wider Atlantic Space.pdf","description":"Outlook for the Fossil fuel and renewable energy industries in the Wider Atlantic Sapce","created":"2015-12-03 12:49:05","modified":"2015-12-03 12:49:05"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"7346","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"7338","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"20","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"7339","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"139","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"139","code":"asia","name":"Asia","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:25","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:25"}},{"id":"7340","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"140","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"7341","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"141","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"141","code":"latin-america","name":"Latin America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:43","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:43"}},{"id":"7342","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"206","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"206","code":"economic-integration","name":"economic integration","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7343","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"26","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"7344","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"108","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"108","code":"energy","name":"Energy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:45","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:45"}},{"id":"7345","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"150","order":"8","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"7346","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1595","code":"north-america-and-latin-america","user_id":"1","title":"NORTH AMERICA AND LATIN AMERICA","abstract":"Working paper&nbsp;Regionalism and Interregionalism in&nbsp;Latin America: The Beginning or the End of Latin America&rsquo;s &lsquo;Continental Integration&rsquo;? by&nbsp;Paul Isbell Centre for Transatlantic Relations Johns Hopkins University-SAIS and&nbsp;Kimberly A.

The paper develops the outlines of the thesis that &lsquo;Latin America&rsquo; or &lsquo;South America&rsquo; no longer provide the optimal geography for constituting an appropriate region, and that new 'ocean basin regions' offer more promising regional and interregional trajectories for Latin American countries to pursue than do their currently conceived land-based &lsquo;trade regions&rsquo;. By &lsquo;re-mapping&rsquo; national figures for bilateral commercial trade culled from the UNCOMTRADE data set, we provide initial quantitative evidence of new Latin American regional trade dynamics emerging within the continent&rsquo;s two flanking ocean basin regions &ndash; the Pacific Basin and the Atlantic Basin &ndash; where new forms of &lsquo;non-hegemonic&rsquo; and &lsquo;maritime-centered&rsquo; regionalisms are being articulated and developed. The paper concludes that new &lsquo;ocean basin regionalisms&rsquo; offer Latin America alternative options for pursuing regional trade agreements and other forms of inter-regional trade integration which, while remaining complementary to the current sub-continental and continental regionalisms, and could become a new guiding frame for Latin American regionalism.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"137","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":false,"type":"0","created":"2015-12-01 12:10:00","modified":"2016-02-05 19:11:13"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"180","content_id":"1595","type":"1","file_name":"1595-Regionalism and interregionalism in Latin America.

The relations between regional organisations in LAC and their peers in North Africa and the Arab world are still fairly nascent and represent a much understudied area of interregionalism in the global order. However, three cases of recent institutional rapprochement between LAC regional organisations (i.e. CELAC, UNASUR and Mercosur) and a North African and Arab world regional institution (i.e. the LAS) are remarkable. The re-launching of South-South cooperation in recent decades in a multipolar context has favoured rapprochement between LAC and the Arab world. Despite the fact that both regions are not a priority for each other, relations and exchanges have grown constantly over the last 10-12 years, accompanied by a progressive institutionalisation of high-level political dialogue. This study aims to identify and analyse the main drivers behind this multi-layered interregionalism as well as the obstacles in its way by examining how it is fostered by political, economic and social state and non-state actors.<\/p>","views":"145","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":false,"type":"0","created":"2015-11-17 12:28:00","modified":"2016-02-03 18:40:54"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"177","content_id":"1531","type":"1","file_name":"1531-Arab c - LAC.pdf","description":"Actors and opportunities: Interregional processes in the Arab region and Latin America and the Caribbean","created":"2015-11-17 12:28:27","modified":"2015-11-17 12:28:27"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"7323","content_id":"1531","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"7316","content_id":"1531","tag_id":"287","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"287","code":"interregionalism","name":"interregionalism","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7317","content_id":"1531","tag_id":"291","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"291","code":"latin-america-and-the-caribbean","name":"latin america and the caribbean","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7318","content_id":"1531","tag_id":"141","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"141","code":"latin-america","name":"Latin America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:43","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:43"}},{"id":"7319","content_id":"1531","tag_id":"140","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"7320","content_id":"1531","tag_id":"289","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"289","code":"cidob","name":"cidob","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7321","content_id":"1531","tag_id":"173","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"173","code":"cide","name":"cide","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7322","content_id":"1531","tag_id":"150","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"7323","content_id":"1531","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1530","code":"latin-america-and-the-eu","user_id":"1","title":"Latin America and the EU","abstract":"Working paper EU-Latin America and Caribbean Inter-regional relations: complexity and change, by&nbsp;Gian Luca Gardini,&nbsp;University Erlangen-N&uuml;rnberg, and&nbsp;Anna Ayuso,&nbsp;CIDOB","body":"<p>This paper analyses regionalism in Latin America and the Caribbean and interregionalism between this region and the European Union.

Also, Latin American and Caribbean regionalisms have constantly evolved in terms of strategies and organisations.

However, since the end of the Cold War there has been an increasing amount of political efforts to strengthen ties on a region-to-region basis. This paper argues that this rapprochement has been facilitated by the emergence of two regional projects following a similar logic in a post-Cold War context: the Southern African Development Community and the Common Market of the Southern Cone. At the same time, both projects face serious limitations of actorness that are illustrative of the confined space for interregionalism across the South Atlantic. An analysis of the formalised initiatives on political, economic and trade issues between the two regions concludes that these are characterised by transregional and partly pure forms of interregionalism and that most initiatives are heavily shaped by the leading role of Brazil.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the working paper here:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>","views":"74","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":false,"type":"0","created":"2015-11-17 12:21:00","modified":"2016-02-03 18:41:00"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"175","content_id":"1529","type":"1","file_name":"1529-LA-Africa.pdf","description":"Regionalism and Interregionalism: The case of Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa","created":"2015-11-17 12:22:01","modified":"2015-11-17 12:22:01"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"7309","content_id":"1529","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"7303","content_id":"1529","tag_id":"287","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"287","code":"interregionalism","name":"interregionalism","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7304","content_id":"1529","tag_id":"178","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"178","code":"university-of-pretoria","name":"University of Pretoria","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:52:42","modified":"2014-04-24 14:52:42"}},{"id":"7305","content_id":"1529","tag_id":"189","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"189","code":"govinn","name":"govinn","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7306","content_id":"1529","tag_id":"141","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"141","code":"latin-america","name":"Latin America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:43","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:43"}},{"id":"7307","content_id":"1529","tag_id":"140","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"7308","content_id":"1529","tag_id":"150","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"7309","content_id":"1529","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1528","code":"europe-and-north-america","user_id":"1","title":"Europe and North America","abstract":"Working paper Regional and Interregional Interactions in Europe, North America and across the North Atlantic, by&nbsp;Riccardo Alcaro,&nbsp;Istituto Affari Internazionali, and&nbsp;Patrick Reilly,&nbsp;German Marshall Fund of the United States","body":"<p>If we figured regionalism as a continuum from rudimental regional interaction to very sophisticated forms of it, Europe stands on this latter end while North America barely makes it to the middle point.

Journalist, writer, internationally renowned playwright, he is professor of media and culture and director of Cesem, HEM Business school research centre in Rabat and its media platform, economia.ma. He used to be editor of liberal Moroccan magazine, TelQuel. Among his late published essays: Le m&eacute;tier d&rsquo;intellectuel, dialogues avec quinze penseurs du Maroc, Coll. Presses de l&rsquo;Universit&eacute; Citoyenne, Ed. En toutes lettres, 2014. Co-founder of Averroes encounters in Rabat, of Dabateatr citoyen and Le Collectif du vivre ensemble, among other cultural initiatives, Ksikes shares his time between research, writing and developing platforms of debates and creativity, both within HEM and in the public space.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q - What opportunities the Atlantic does offer to Morocco?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A - It is, first, noteworthy, that Morocco has a voluntarily multi-oriented &ldquo;policy&rdquo;. Politically, considerations of post-colonial autonomy and bonds with emerging powers are added to the need of classical powers&rsquo;s support to help in the western Sahara conflict. Economically, while being to a large extent dependent on European market and funds \/ investments from Gulf countries, Morocco is more and more engaged in developing its west african backyard, leading hopefully a security, logistic, innovation and investment regional hub. Its booming industrial and services policies are not yet full-fledged but could potentially be directed that way.<\/p>\r\n<p>The vertical, Afro-European axis, added to American partial Alliance for strategic purposes give theoretically to the Moroccan Atlantic orientations enough reasons to look necessary. The need also to strike a balance between western values and Islamic heritage, as a landmark of the regime, make also of the Atlantic space a good resort for Morocco. Last but not least, while considering security as one of its main political assets, Morocco is necessarily hankering for NATO partnerships and bilateral conventions to develop its role as a regional trustworthy ally for the western major countries and a reliable north African watch-dog.<\/p>\r\n<p>Finally, looking westwards, more than ever before, helps Morocco reconsider its historical and continental heritage, its maritime unused assets and its institutional and diplomatic flaws that he needs badly to build a genuine international policy.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q &ndash; What is the view of the Atlantic from the North of Africa?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A - From a North African perspective, where Maghreb, the closer space, is a big failure, the Atlantic is seen as a far-fetched idea, and even physically as a far away world to put together. It is also considered as a sum of scattered spaces with divergent interests and perspectives. It is also seen as an unbalanced space where the interdependencies between the North and the South are mostly unilateral.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>If we are to rationalize things a bit, the Atlantic is perceived as a threatening alternative to the Mediterranean, which never managed to re-emerge as a regional space. The Atlantic is actually first identified to the North Atlantic order, and more and more, since TTIP launching, to Europe-US alliance. Having weak maritime power and culture, North Africa is in a certain sense mainly considering an Atlantic alternative view from a continental point of view. Thus having a blossoming African policy is seen as the first step to a southern input into the Atlantic. Being also the source of some terrorist, drug and migrant flows, the Atlantic is looked upon as a threatening space to control and regulate, for themselves and their northern partners.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q - <\/strong><strong>What are the main challenges for the emergence of the Atlantic space?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A - In the current context where the European Union and United States are planning to sign TTIP, where EU is more than ever weakened by migrant and asylum seeking floods, and where, for anti-terrorist reasons and to counter new Russian expansionism, NATO is recovering its old prerogatives, many doubts are rising about possible re-shaping of the Atlantic. When this project, &ldquo;Atlantic Future&rdquo;, was tailored, four years ago, the international context was not as tense and conflict-bound as it looks today. To make the perspective look again attainable, we need more visionary and sound leaders who would know how to put peace, solidarity, social inclusion and economic development on the top of political priorities.<\/p>\r\n<p>Besides, to make it possible for this space to emerge, there should be an earnest interest in southern countries development not only as tactics but as a necessity and a must. There should be also awareness that each country has to make internally of democracy a real horizon not a fake mask for external and media consumption.

His current research focuses on the role and functions of science-based policy institutes or \"think tanks\" in theory and practice, the interactions among policy domains and international relations, and global governance on environment, resources, climate and energy<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: <\/strong><strong>What do you see when you look at the energy sector through an Atlantic lens?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: The world&rsquo;s energy systems are Atlantic. This is true for coal, the fuel that started the industrial revolution and powered industry and especially mining. It is also true for other fossil energy carriers: oil including shale oil and tar sands and methane. The nuclear industry started in the WWII era in the North Atlantic and financially sustained by Atlantic government subsidies before going global.&nbsp; The recent onset of fracking is an essentially North American phenomenon.<\/p>\r\n<p>Early development of renewable energy technologies including solar energy and wind turbines started in the US before globalizing. Bio-energy at industrial scale is also of Atlantic provenance, from sugar cane to alcohol as transport fuel in Brazil, corn-to-ethanol for fuel blending in the US, to canola (rape seed) to bio-diesel or general agricultural waste to biogas to bio-genic electricity in the EU.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: <\/strong><strong>What are the trends and dynamics of energy in the Atlantic space?&nbsp; <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: Nuclear power and fossil energies are declining due to generally rising long-term costs. Many companies are heading for write-downs, economic abandonment or insolvency and possible government bail-outs. The Atlantic nations have overdeveloped both fossil and nuclear energy, incurring enormous political and security costs, e.g. climate change.<\/p>\r\n<p>Renewable energy development and use is increasing, but at different rates and sometimes from a low starting basis. Cost improvements result from new inventions, material discoveries as well as technological, business, and policy learning curves, particularly for solar energy and storage. The roll-out of IT-based technology is accelerating both in relation to existing technologies and the investment and development of new energy systems. This transformation is proving disruptive to the old, dirty and dangerous fossil and nuclear energy industries. The Age of Energy Transformation away from fossil and nuclear towards renewable energy supply with storage in a smart grid is originally an Atlantic phenomenon, conceived as an idea by Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute in the US, and now epitomised by the German \"Energiewende\" entering practically all Atlantic languages.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What does the Atlantic future energy system look like?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: While the true costs of fossil and nuclear systems are becoming ever more obvious, pressure mounts for public budgets to phase-out the perverse subsidies that favour them. Energy efficiency, renewable and storage technologies are becoming ever cheaper. As a consequence, energy-related trade and investment patterns will change. Instead of energy carriers such as coal and gas being traded, it will be equipment for renewable power generation and storage for various kinds. The total cost of energy supply will decline, and asset values of energy infrastructure will fall. More energy will be consumed close to the point of production.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;What are the trigger points of potential cooperation in the Atlantic space?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: Atlantic nations should cooperate to accelerate the energy transformation. A key measure is reforming energy-related taxation, including scrapping perverse subsidies and privileges for fossil and nuclear energy. Governments should agree to facilitate the trade in goods and services relating to energy efficiency, renewable energies, storage and smart grids. Tariffs still imposed should be removed, perhaps by \"coordinated unilateralism\".&nbsp; Local, regional or national content obligations in government procurement rules should be scrapped. In order to facilitate the trade in biogenic energy, stringent sustainability criteria should be agreed for the production and processing of biomass. The Atlantic nations might follow the \"top-runner\" approach so that the best practice concerning energy efficiency or energy conversion in any one country or company becomes the norm after 3 or 5 years. That would speed invention, innovation and dissemination of desirable technologies throughout the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the Atlantic Voices here:<\/strong><\/p>","views":"952","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-10-08 17:13:00","modified":"2016-02-08 04:00:01"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"171","content_id":"1131","type":"1","file_name":"1131-ATLANTIC VOICES_02_R.A.

With this objective in mind regional trends and dynamics have been presented and analysed in this paper. However, interviewees not only had particular difficulty thinking about the Atlantic in terms of a unified geopolitical space but also agreed that, for the time being at least, we could not speak of the emergence of this geopolitical space. Because, despite the common ground that exists among the regions of the Atlantic, the context of international reconfiguration being experienced today, and the prevalence of national and regional dynamics still have direct impact on the social and political mindset of the Atlantic sub-regions. For the interviewees, the notion of the Atlantic space is simply not in the quintessence&nbsp;of the region and lacks the political leadership that is needed for this.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from International Organizations in New York and Washington, D.C.<\/strong>(by Elizabeth Tedsen,Ecologic Institute)<\/p>\r\n<p>The conventional dynamics of pan-Atlantic relations and North-South dichotomy have changed dramatically over the past ten to twenty years, with Southern countries rising to greater economic and political prominence. Fundamental changes are taking place within and between Atlantic countries, yet many of these are eclipsed by, or ultimately part of, growing globalization and multipolarity. These may be accompanied by the relative decline of the European Union as it turns inward to meet internal challenges and as political and economic gravities shift. Historical and cultural ties provide a deep foundation for interregional cooperation between Atlantic countries on issues such as trade, drug trafficking, and governance of shared commons.&nbsp; Yet whether these ties can form the basis for a new &ldquo;Atlantic Rim,&rdquo; or whether instead the dynamics and trends within the Atlantic herald an increasingly interconnected and globalized world whereby the relevance of these linkages weakens, remains to be seen.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the two papers here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"162","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-10-07 10:17:00","modified":"2016-02-03 05:20:35"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"145","content_id":"1108","type":"1","file_name":"1108-ATLANTIC FUTURE_Perspectives from IO in Geneva.pdf","description":"Perspectives from International Organizations in Geneva (by Paula de Castro, CIDOB)","created":"2015-09-08 10:18:02","modified":"2015-09-08 10:18:02"},{"id":"146","content_id":"1108","type":"1","file_name":"1108-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from New York and Washington.pdf","description":"Perspectives from International Organizations in New York and Washington, D.C.

The papers expose the results of interviews carried out in Brussels, France, Portugal, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, United Kingdom and the Netherlands. &nbsp;","body":"<p><strong>Perspectives from Brussels <\/strong>(by Elisa Lled&oacute;, FRIDE, and Danielle Piatkiewicz, GMF)<\/p>\r\n<p>Is a new pan-Atlantic system of relations emerging in the Atlantic space beyond the traditional North Atlantic alliance and the North-South dependency? Although there was no unanimous opinion, many interviewees from various sectors in Brussels appeared to be sceptical about this potential scenario (there was a strong EU-US transatlantic space but weak relations with the South), while others claimed that the Atlantic Basin could be more interconnected, mainly in economic terms. GMF and FRIDE, with their respective offices used their networks to interview the relevant actors based on their professional and academic expertise. The main concerns regarding the current state and future of the Atlantic region included, amongst others: the future of the TTIP trade negotiation between the US and the EU, the lack of a cohesive &ldquo;Atlantic&rdquo; security approach, the struggle for a united and common energy and climate and environmental policy within the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from France <\/strong>(by Danielle Piatkiewicz and Bruno Medroa, GMF)<\/p>\r\n<p>The Atlantic Future project explores the concept that new relations are emerging in the Atlantic space beyond the traditional North Atlantic alliance and the North-South dependency. GMF, with their respective office in Paris, France, used their networks to interview the relevant actors based on their professional and academic expertise. The main consensus on the emergence of a pan- Atlantic space was mixed. The main concerns on the current and future state of the Atlantic region from the Paris perspective touched on the following;&nbsp; future of the trade and investment, along with the negotiation of free trade agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the U.S. and the EU. The respondents identified the need for different priorities between North and South Atlantic. It was strongly expressed that Europe and the U.S. remain the most important actors for the global economy, along with China and India. However, countries like Brazil or South Africa have been rising as economic models rather than as economic powers, and show an increased influence from the Southern Atlantic countries.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Portugal <\/strong>(by Daniel Marcos,IPRI-NOVA University)<\/p>\r\n<p>The creation of a pan-Atlantic space, based on cooperation between the different regions of the Atlantic is fundamental for the future of the Atlantic basin, capable to deal with the emergence of new powers in the Asia-Pacific Rim and the threats that emerged with the end of the Cold War: terrorism, migration trends, illicit trafficking, fragile states, etc. The analysis of four specific areas &ndash; economy and finances, security, people and institutions, resources and environment &ndash; has shown the existence of different stages of development of the Atlantic basin countries, mainly between the North and the South, which must be overcome by cooperation in these same areas. For Portuguese stakeholders, the European Union, African Union and NATO have a fundamental role to play, but EU is mostly seen as a role model to be followed for the development of regional and interregional cooperation. The challenge is to overcome the lack of leadership of EU in the last 5 years and the traditional suspicion of the South Atlantic regarding to the North in order to deepen the relations between the shores of the Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Spain <\/strong>(by Susanne Gratius, FRIDE)<\/p>\r\n<p>The perceptions and opinions of Spanish stakeholders on the Atlantic are highly diverse but coincide in the need to include Latin America in Transatlantic relations. Most interviewees in Spain focused on economic aspects and security interests in the Atlantic, while people and institutions, resources and environment ranked second. The overwhelming majority of interviewees shared a rather sceptical view on the future of the Atlantic as an articulated and institutionalized space or a community of values. There was also a consensus on the view that Latin America is part of the Atlantic identity, while Africa is more distant in terms of values and norms, development and common interest. The North-South divide is still present, but most interviewees agreed on the need for a more balanced and horizontal relationship taking into account the power shifts towards regional leaders like Brazil, Mexico or South Africa, on the one hand, and multinational companies and &ldquo;global civil society networks, on the other.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Germany&nbsp;<\/strong>(by Christoph H. Stefes,Ecologic Institute Berlin)<\/p>\r\n<p>The twenty individuals from Germany interviewed for this project emphasized the critical importance of transatlantic relations for Europe. Despite its relative decline in power, the United States is still considered Europe&rsquo;s most important security and economic partner. The interviewees accordingly emphasized the need to conclude the current TTIP negotiations successfully. The emergence of a pan-Atlantic community on the other hand met more scepticism, as interviewees pointed towards the still existing lack of consolidated liberal democracies and resilient markets in Latin America and even more so in Africa. Moreover, they perceived a lack of common values and shared interests across the regions of the South Atlantic and the regions of the North Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Italy&nbsp;<\/strong>(by Andrea Dess&igrave; and Chiara Rosselli,Istituto Affari Internazionali)<\/p>\r\n<p>On the whole sceptical about the notion of an emerging pan-Atlantic space, Italian stakeholders converged around the necessity of strengthening the transatlantic relationship as the primary means to ensure a continued relevance on the world stage and greater conformity to EU-US norms and standards among Atlantic countries. While impossible to ignore the rising influence of Asia and China in the Atlantic, Europe and the US maintain certain margins of influence and leverage within this space. Supportive of the TTIP, stakeholders emphasised Europe&rsquo;s internal divisions, a lack of trust and the persistence of paternalism in North-South relations as the primary obstacles for the emergence of closer cooperation among Atlantic countries.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Poland <\/strong>(by Corinna H\u04e7rst and Danielle Piatkiewicz,GMF)<\/p>\r\n<p>The concept of a new pan-Atlantic system of relations emerging in the Atlantic space beyond the traditional North Atlantic alliance and the North-South dependency has captured the Atlantic space. Polish interviewees from Warsaw viewed the idea with a measure of scepticism. Although there was no unanimous opinion, many interviewees from various sectors in Warsaw appeared to be sceptical about this potential scenario stating that the lack of a unified EU and Europe could prevent this idea from forming. The German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) and their Warsaw based office used their networks to interview the relevant actors based on their professional and academic expertise. The overall main concerns regarding the current state and future of the Atlantic region included, amongst others: the current and future state of transatlantic relations, the future of the TTIP trade negotiation between the US and the EU, the lack of a cohesive &ldquo;Atlantic&rdquo; security approach, the U.S.&rsquo;s shift towards other regions, and the lack of a cohesive energy and climate and environmental policy both within the EU and the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from the UK <\/strong>(by Sangeeta Khorana and Christina Stolte)<\/p>\r\n<p>Interviews in London informed us about the stakeholders&rsquo; perceptions in four thematic areas of the Atlantic Future project, which include: economy and finance, security, people and institutions, resources and environment. Main themes of focus were: changes over the past 20 years; drivers for change or continuity; prospective view of the changes and continuities in the region; actors and regional leaders (state or non-state level); relevance of the EU; perceptions on the evolution of the EU&rsquo;s role in the region over the past 20 years; and finally the convergence or divergence of norms within the Atlantic space. Based on the interview results in the UK, the paper reports that developments in the Atlantic have led to a proliferation of economic and non-economic initiatives amongst various Atlantic actors, both in the North and South. In the North, the North Atlantic community and the USA and EU is undergoing major changes in economic, security and political terms. Following the spectacular rise of Brazil and Africa, the focus has been gradually shifting from the EU and USA and new dynamics is evolving in the Atlantic space. However, a Pan Atlantic space is not really emerging but if the ongoing Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and USA were successful this could herald the beginning of a new Atlantic space. The EU is and continues to be an important player in the Atlantic, and is likely to play an influential role in the reconfiguration of the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from the Netherlands <\/strong>(by Lucy Olivia Smith,Ecologic Institute Berlin)<\/p>\r\n<p>Twenty individuals from the Netherlands were interviewed for this report on transatlantic geopolitics. While the North-Atlantic relationships between Europe and the US remains strong and established in issues related to security and economy, the project sought to gauge whether there was a budding pan-Atlantic community. Rather than confirm this idea, the interviewees highlighted the emergence of substantial emerging economies in Latin America and Africa and through this observation, emphasized the increasing polarity of the international community that is increasingly defined by diverse axis of power and significance and less so by traditional power blocs. While some specific topics had a distinctly Atlantic dimension, such as the issue of immigration and drug trafficking, most matters related to economy and security were firmly entrenched in the reality of a truly globalised world. When forming ideas of how Europe could maintain relevance, several interviewees saw the EU as a model for supra-national governance structures and demilitarisation and as defining itself in a soft power role.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the nine papers here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"166","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-10-07 07:55:00","modified":"2016-02-06 21:57:23"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"149","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-AF_WP7_ Deliverable 7.2.pdf","description":"Introduction","created":"2015-09-08 10:57:01","modified":"2015-09-08 10:57:01"},{"id":"150","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from Belgium_Brussels.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Brussels (by Elisa Lled\u00f3, FRIDE, and Danielle Piatkiewicz, GMF)","created":"2015-09-08 10:57:36","modified":"2015-09-08 10:57:36"},{"id":"151","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspecties from France_ Paris.pdf","description":"Perspectives from France (by Danielle Piatkiewicz and Bruno Medroa, GMF)","created":"2015-09-08 10:58:00","modified":"2015-09-08 10:58:00"},{"id":"152","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from Portugal.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Portugal (by Daniel Marcos, IPRI-NOVA University)","created":"2015-09-08 10:58:22","modified":"2015-09-08 10:58:22"},{"id":"153","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from Spain_ Madrid.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Spain (by Susanne Gratius, FRIDE)","created":"2015-09-08 10:59:03","modified":"2015-09-08 10:59:03"},{"id":"154","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from Germany.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Germany (by Christoph H.

perceptions on the Atlantic space across the American continent. The papers expose the results of interviews carried out in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia and Honduras, and US and Canada. &nbsp;","body":"<p><strong>Perspectives from Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela <\/strong>(In&ecirc;s Sousa, FGV &ndash; NPII)<\/p>\r\n<p>This paper explores the perspectives of Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela on the potential emergence of a pan-Atlantic system of relations beyond the North-North alliance and North South dependency. Interviews were conducted with specialists from various sectors in each of the aforementioned countries. We found a consensus on the perspective that increasing political and economic links between South America and Africa are being established. The increase in Chinese investments in South America and Africa is considered to be determinant to the on-going political and economic transformations taking place in the Atlantic basin.&nbsp; The role of EU is considered relevant, seen as a potential mediator and an actor able to somewhat balance US influence as well as Chinese presence in South America and Africa. Overall, a pan-Atlantic system of relations is not considered to be taking shape. All point out to the (political, social, economic, cultural&hellip;) differences found in the South Atlantic itself, as well as in relation to the North. The present findings should be considered by the EU when designing its external policies and initiatives involving Southern countries. It is our assessment that any venture that disregards the views observed during this research and summarized here would most likely not be successful.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Mexico, Colombia and Honduras<\/strong> (by Mark Aspinwall, Elsy Gonz&aacute;lez &amp; Lorena Ruano, CIDE)<\/p>\r\n<p>This paper reports on the findings of field interviews with elites in Mexico, Colombia, and Honduras. Interviewees were questioned on their views of the relevance of issues, partners, cooperation and conflict across the Atlantic space. Key topics mentioned repeatedly by interviewees across the three countries were migration, drug trafficking, and the importance of the USA as a global partner. In the area of security, all interviewees see the USA as the principal actor, with terrorism and fragile states as the main threats. In the environment, the thinking of interviewees was more global than regional, but all saw climate change as the main issue. In terms of trade and finance, liberalization and cooperation were the predominant lines of thinking, while in people and institutions, democratization and migration were key topics. Democracy, markets, and cooperation were seen as common values across the Atlantic. Prospects for cooperation would be improved if Northern states and regions paid more attention to the South, according to the interviewees, but there was also a significant current of opinion that Latin America (and more particularly, some of its main actors, like Brazil and Colombia) is emerging in its own right.&nbsp;Prospects for an Atlantic partnership seem slim, and there does not seem to be an automatic perception of the Atlantic as a relevant geopolitical concept, though there is no consensus on what is the most important obstacle. Some say it is cultural differences and government inconsistency and indifference, while others blame financing problems. Language, distance, transportation, infrastructure, poor management of aid funding, time zones, and culture were all mentioned. However, the regions of the Atlantic are seen as relevant units of study. Cooperation within Latin America was seen as valuable in order to prevent exploitation by the North. Notwithstanding this pessimism, in each of the three countries, two-thirds of elites say that an Atlantic Rim is taking shape. Public sector and academic officials are more likely to say yes, while private sector, media and NGO officials are more mixed. Likewise, opinion about the utility and benefits of Atlantic cooperation in all three states is very favorable, especially so in Honduras.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Canada and the United States&nbsp;<\/strong>(by Daniel S. Hamilton<strong>, <\/strong>Center for Transatlantic Relations, Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies)<\/p>\r\n<p>Canadian and American opinion leaders are aware of many changing dynamics affecting the countries and peoples of the broad Atlantic space, yet do not have a uniform view of what such changes mean for pan-Atlantic cooperation or the emergence of a broad ''Atlantic'' consciousness. Most believe that there will be greater cooperation in the Atlantic in the next 5 to 15 years, but also believe that informal networks are more likely to be effective that formal structures to facilitate such cooperation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the three papers here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"107","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-10-06 10:13:00","modified":"2016-02-06 15:01:26"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"142","content_id":"1107","type":"1","file_name":"1107-ATLANTIC FUTURE_WP7_Perspectives from Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela (In\u00eas Sousa, FGV \u2013 NPII) ","created":"2015-09-08 10:14:06","modified":"2015-09-08 10:14:06"},{"id":"143","content_id":"1107","type":"1","file_name":"1107-ATLANTIC FUTURE_WP7_Perspectives from Mexico, Colombia and Honduras.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Mexico, Colombia and Honduras (by Mark Aspinwall, Elsy Gonz\u00e1lez & Lorena Ruano, CIDE)","created":"2015-09-08 10:15:21","modified":"2015-09-08 10:15:21"},{"id":"144","content_id":"1107","type":"1","file_name":"1107-ATLANTIC FUTURE_WP7_Perspectives from Canada and the United States.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Canada and the United States (by Daniel S.

Through multiple interviews with representatives from a wide spectrum of Angola&rsquo;s society, the main trends, risks and opportunities in this area are explored while the role of norms and values, cooperation and regionalism as potential drivers of further relations are weighted in and evaluated. Ultimately, the paper addresses the main question of knowing whether or not Angola perceives new dynamics in the Atlantic as existent and\/or desirable and reflects on what role the country might play in the long run in such kind of regional scenario.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Cameroon, South Africa and West Africa <\/strong>(by&nbsp;Frank Mattheis,&nbsp;Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation, University of Pretoria)<\/p>\r\n<p>This paper studies how selected experts from West Africa, Cameroon and South Africa assess the potential of an emerging Atlantic space. Covering representatives from various sectors in society, the analysed interviews reveal how divergence and convergence is perceived in terms of economics, institutions, energy and security. The findings reveal a very cautious approach to the idea of an Atlantic space. The priorities of political imaginations appear to be centred on national interests and on the rise of Asia in the global order, leaving very little excitement for a project with regions that are either seen as dominant (Europe and North America) or unknown (South America). The strengthening of an Atlantic identity and of a potential Pan-Atlantic institution will therefore require a decided change of perception among the targeted actors in West Africa, Cameroon and South Africa towards the other Atlantic regions. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Morocco&nbsp;<\/strong>(by&nbsp;Sqalli Hammad, HEM-CESEM)<\/p>\r\n<p>This paper presents Moroccan perspectives and perceptions of the construction of a pan-Atlantic space. Findings are based on 20 interviews covering 4 thematic areas: economy and finance, security, people and institutions, resources and environment. They show the multileveled complexity of the issues at hand and the near absence of a vision of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, emergent initiatives are not counteracting an Atlantic will. Moroccans are not anywhere near an Atlantic project aimed at integrating economies and people; domestic issues and new African perspective seem to take precedence over an immediate pan-Atlantic configuration.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Cape Verde<\/strong> (Katarina Pereira da Costa, HEM-CESEM)<\/p>\r\n<p>The interviews were carried out in Cape Verde using a standardised questionnaire developed by the Atlantic Future project. The interviewee&rsquo;s were people (of both genders) from the public sector, private sector, academia, media and civil society and the interviews covered the thematic areas of economy and finance, security, people and institutions and resources and environment subject of study of the Atlantic Future project. Most interviewees perceived a pan-Atlantic space taking shape or at least they expressed their desire that it could emerge would be happening. They saw a movement towards cooperation especially in economics and security. Many suggestions were made on how to stimulate the creation of a pan-Atlantic space by those who did not forseen a pan-Atlantic taking shape yet or whom believed it is still a very insignificant movement.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the four papers

Emerging countries are changing the global balance of power, altering the character of the global political economy, and bringing new interests and ideas into the international arena. At the same time, international politics is characterised by a growing number of international institutions. These range from formal intergovernmental organizations like the UN Security Council or the Financial Stability Board, to informal clubs like the G7, BRICS and IBSA forums, to commonly accepted ideas and norms, and even to transnational private institutions like the International Accounting Standards Board. Few of these institutions are unaffected by the economic shift towards emerging markets or by the power shift between national governments. The impact of a changed power balance can occur within the institutions themselves, by altering their status and effectiveness, or by changing the relations of international institutions to each other. Moreover, these institutions have important effects on the global economy and on inter-state relations, including their propensity for violence.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Maritime Security<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Maritime Security is perhaps the latest addition to the international security vocabulary. Several security actors, including NATO, the EU, the AU and the UK have launched maritime security strategies recently which foregrounds the salience of the theme. At the same time security studies is gradually discovering the importance of the maritime dimension and researchers from around the world have launched investigations that go beyond the traditional concerns with naval strategy and sea battles. This section aims to discuss a range of emerging themes related to maritime security, including perspectives on core maritime issues, such as piracy, maritime crime, human trafficking, illegal fishing, boundary disputes, port security, and maritime security sector reform. The objective will be to build connection between traditional security studies, institutionalist research and contemporary critical security studies.<\/p>\r\n<p>More information: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paneuropeanconference.org\/2015\/\">http:\/\/www.paneuropeanconference.org\/2015\/<\/a><\/p>","views":"41","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":false,"type":"1","created":"2015-09-26 09:00:00","modified":"2016-01-10 04:04:48"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":"946","datetime":"2015-09-23 09:00:00","country":"Italy","city":"Sicily","address":"","map":""},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"5535","content_id":"946","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"5534","content_id":"946","tag_id":"208","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"208","code":"maritime-security","name":"maritime security","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"5535","content_id":"946","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"945","code":"conference-atlantic-communities","user_id":"1","title":"Conference \u201cAtlantic Communities\u201d","abstract":"ATLANTIC FUTURE will participate in the I International Conference &ldquo;Atlantic Communities: Translation, Mobility, Hospitality&rdquo; to be held in Vigo, Spain on 17-18 September 2015.","body":"<p>The Atlantic Ocean has historically played a major role in the relationship between the &ldquo;Old World&rdquo; and the &ldquo;New World&rdquo;, both perceived as a geographical and cultural divide between continents but also functioning as a space of transit, mobility and hospitality.

This paper examines the dynamics of four key environment and resources issues, looking to the 2020\/2025 horizon: climate mitigation and energy transformations; food security; overfishing; and wildlife trafficking and biodiversity loss. Each is global in nature, yet Atlantic actors play influential roles and have shared interests in, and critical resources for, addressing them. Underlying these challenges are regional and global drivers of resource consumption and production. Rising demand for resources to feed growing and wealthier populations is shifting global production and consumption patterns, and in turn, creating heavy environmental strain. Where policy solutions prove insufficient to internalize costs, economic interests will continue to drive unsustainable, and often illegal, resource use and consumption. Nevertheless, despite negative trajectories in many areas, the Atlantic Space offers unique opportunities for concerted action and furthering networks of state and non-state actors to address the environmental challenges of today and of the future through coordinated regional action.<\/p>","views":"251","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-09-11 17:08:00","modified":"2016-01-31 22:41:04"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"163","content_id":"1113","type":"1","file_name":"1113-WP9_Ecologic_Patterns of Production and Consumption in the Atlantic Space and Future Environment and Resource Scenarios.pdf","description":"Patterns of Production and Consumption in the Atlantic Space and Future Environment and Resource Scenarios","created":"2015-09-10 17:20:20","modified":"2015-09-10 17:20:20"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"6351","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"6344","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"162","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"162","code":"resources","name":"resources","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"6345","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"107","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"107","code":"climate-change","name":"Climate change","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:29","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:29"}},{"id":"6346","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"108","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"108","code":"energy","name":"Energy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:45","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:45"}},{"id":"6347","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"163","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"163","code":"food-security","name":"food security","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"6348","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"211","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"211","code":"illicit-trafficking","name":"illicit trafficking","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"6349","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"109","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"109","code":"environment","name":"Environment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:06:53","modified":"2013-09-27 11:06:53"}},{"id":"6350","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"242","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"242","code":"food-production","name":"food production","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"6351","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1115","code":"atlantics-emerging-security-challenges","user_id":"1","title":"Atlantic\u2019s Emerging Security Challenges","abstract":"In much contrast to the territorial disputes and military tensions defining the Pacific Rim, the Atlantic remains a relatively stable geo-political sphere, largely due to the lack of great power conflict.

Cooperation in the Atlantic Basin will probably take place &lsquo;<em>&agrave; la carte&rsquo;<\/em>, rather than on the basis of a clear all-encompassing institutional design. Democracy is the prevalent form of government across the Atlantic, but with major regional variations and a predominance of hybrid or authoritarian regimes in Africa. Socio-economic challenges also differ considerably among Atlantic countries. Social inequalities within countries have been growing larger in recent years in both advanced and developing countries. Demography will be a critical factor for the future of the Atlantic, with Africa being the only region where high population growth rates are expected and Europe being the fastest ageing region. Beyond states, the influence of multinational companies, NGOs, social networks, sub-national entities (cities, regions) and migrant communities over government decisions and within multilateral organisations and fora is set to grow. Therefore, future convergence in the Atlantic Basin cannot be planned top-down, but needs to encompass and build on the perspectives and priorities of societal actors, from the bottom up.&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"91","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-09-10 17:11:00","modified":"2016-02-06 10:09:48"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"164","content_id":"1114","type":"1","file_name":"1114-WP9_FRIDE_Political, social and cultural trends in the Atlantic.pdf","description":"Political, social and cultural trends in the Atlantic","created":"2015-09-10 17:21:38","modified":"2015-09-10 17:21:38"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"6212","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},{"id":"6206","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"85","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"85","code":"culture","name":"Culture","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:54:50","modified":"2013-09-27 10:54:50"}},{"id":"6207","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"24","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"24","code":"political-relations","name":"Political relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:04:54","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:54"}},{"id":"6208","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"99","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"99","code":"political-systems","name":"Political systems","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:58:08","modified":"2013-09-27 10:58:08"}},{"id":"6209","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"272","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"272","code":"development-gap","name":"development gap","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"6210","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"23","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"23","code":"social-relations","name":"Social relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:08:58","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:58"}},{"id":"6211","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"273","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"273","code":"non-governmental-actors","name":"non governmental actors","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"6212","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"944","code":"webinar-regionalisms-across-the-atlantic1","user_id":"1","title":"Webinar: Regionalisms across the Atlantic","abstract":"The second Atlantic Future webinar &ldquo;Regionalisms across the Atlantic: divergences and convergences&rdquo; took place on 22 June and was conducted by Dr Frank Mattheis, Senior Researcher at the Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation at the University of Pretoria, and Atlantic Future partner.

E.g. Pacific Alliance and Eastern Africa. Would you say that is true?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>South American countries, such as Brazil emphasize the fact that the South Atlantic dynamics are very different from the North Atlantic.

The seminar, entitled &ldquo;The Future of the Atlantic: Common dynamics or different paths?&rdquo;was held in the margins of the ATLANTIC FUTURE Plenary Meeting in Lisbon and aimed to discuss the present and the future of the Atlantic basin taking into account the transformations that we have assisted in the last twenty years. While the relations between the North America and Europe remained very strong, we are witnessing a strong growth of Africa and Latin America. Their weight in the international system has grown in relevance in areas such as economy, energy, security, human and institutional development and environment. In the meantime, we are observing a tremendous growth in Asia-Pacific area and with emerging powers like China becoming relevant actors in the Atlantic space.","body":"<p>The Lunch Seminar sought to reinforce the interest of postgraduate students from universities in Lisbon (Institute of Social Sciences &ndash; University of Lisbon; Institute of Social and an Political Sciences &ndash; University of Lisbon; Institute for Political Studies of the Catholic University; School of Social and Human Sciences of the NOVA University of Lisbon; University Institute of Lisbon) working already in the Atlantic to deepen their research interests on the topic. Chaired by Daniel Marcos from IPRI-NOVA, the seminar begun with his remarks on the importance of the Atlantic and then gave the floor to three experts: Victor Borges, Former Cape Verde Foreign Minister; Dorval Brunelle, Professor at the University of Quebec in Montreal and Carlos Gaspar, member of the board of the IPRI-NOVA and Professor at the NOVA University of Lisbon.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Victor Borges presentation focused on four main ideas: 1) recognizing the existence of different interests and perspectives in the Atlantic; 2) setting the grounds for the discussion of the Atlantic; 3) building up common concerns; and 4) working together (States, regional and inter-regional entities and even international institutions, like the UN through the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea). According to him, to develop a better future it is necessary to take into account the past and to understand the present. Focusing on the features of the past, he spoke of the economic supremacy of the North, the European expeditions, the slavery and natural resources exploitation that had a huge impact on the North-South relations. Regarding the present, today&rsquo;s profound development divide is also important - too much dependency and poverty in the South while the North has some sort of convergence; and the political, economic, territorial and military presence of North powers in the South. But despite obvious strategic differences, Victor Borges defended that there is space to harmonize the relation between the North and the South with common grounds and cooperation, focusing on national and regional security, human security, economics, trade, energy supply, food security, maritime protection, drug trafficking and other illegal activities. Later, he defended that to understand which players should build a common future it is important to take into account institutional players like states, but also regional entities and non-institutional players. This will lead to a wide Atlantic area with peace, security, stability and acceptable governance, common values and legality instead of power, and regional and interregional coordination.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/847-1430814260.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Dorval Brunelle started his presentation by setting the grounds for the Atlantic Future project, to &ldquo;where did it came and where it will go?&rdquo;, warning of the problems of a state centric approach of the future of the Atlantic or the limitations of the international level analysis. He highlighted the relevance of the local level analysis, focusing on the pollution, fishermen, oil rigs, the users of the ocean and that have a huge impact in the Atlantic. Focusing on the conceptual tools, he identified cities as very important actors. The problems of the Atlantic are happening at local level. Dorval Brunelle believes that two opposing trends are happening in the ocean space: the &ldquo;maritimisation of territory&rdquo; and a &ldquo;territorialisation of maritime space&rdquo;. The first one focusing on the security of maritime lines, the supply by sea routes and sea transport is much cheaper than by land &ndash; the water doesn&rsquo;t cost anything. The second focuses on the conflicting claims the seas have been object of. The land and ocean space share common grounds so it is important to construct a new way to see the interface between ocean and land, to limit the misuse of the ocean. Finally, to rethink the Atlantic he believes that it is important to include the geographers, develop new programmes that do not jump from the local to the regional and international level and that can give us new ways to see the sea.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/847-1430814653.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>At the end, Carlos Gaspar raised the question about the Atlantic being an autonomous entity in international politics. According to him, it can be seen as 1) an organized system, a &ldquo;region of regions&rdquo; with no regional conflict among regional great powers; 2) a democratic system &ndash; all four regions are led by democratic powers and a great majority of the regions member states are pluralist democracies; 3) with relevant historical and cultural convergence between all regions of the Atlantic. All of this allows common dynamics leading to the peaceful convergence of the main regional actors. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that the Atlantic constitute a regional entity. The factors that are at the basis of the North Atlantic alliance differ from those that shaped the relation between the rest of the Atlantic and the convergence common to the four regions cannot be taken for granted: it works to balance the expansion of Asia and to face the escalation of conflicts between the major powers in the Indo-Pacific system, defining itself as a pole of stability in the international system.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>After this, the lunch was served, during which the students exchanged views with the speakers and with the partners of the ATLANTIC FUTURE.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"261","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-05-05 09:41:00","modified":"2016-02-08 16:44:16"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"5261","content_id":"847","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"5255","content_id":"847","tag_id":"246","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"246","code":"lisbon","name":"lisbon","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"5256","content_id":"847","tag_id":"54","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"54","code":"perspectives","name":"Perspectives","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:43:59","modified":"2013-09-27 10:43:59"}},{"id":"5257","content_id":"847","tag_id":"147","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"147","code":"international-relations","name":"international relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-11-18 11:32:59","modified":"2013-11-18 11:32:59"}},{"id":"5258","content_id":"847","tag_id":"5","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"5","code":"atlantic-space","name":"Atlantic space","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:55:08","modified":"2013-09-27 09:55:08"}},{"id":"5259","content_id":"847","tag_id":"15","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"5260","content_id":"847","tag_id":"53","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"53","code":"north-atlantic","name":"North Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:53:35","modified":"2013-09-27 11:53:35"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"5261","content_id":"847","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"837","code":"public-event-in-lisbon","user_id":"1","title":"Public event in Lisbon","abstract":"The ATLANTIC FUTURE third plenary meeting was held in Lisboa, Portugal, on 22-24 April 2015 and hosted by IPRI-NOVA.&nbsp;The meeting started with a public event on &ldquo;Setting the Grounds for a New Understanding of the Atlantic&rdquo;.

Teixeira opened the floor by welcoming the assistants and by presenting the speakers. He then spoke of the Atlantic by referring how the end of the Cold War accelerated democratisation in the Atlantic. As a result, there is a new homogeneity in the interaction between US, Brazil, Europe, Africa and Latin America. There is recognition of common interests in international security issues, an increase in economic exchange, and growing linkages in several areas. Overall, there is more interaction in the broad Atlantic area.<\/p>\r\n<p>He wondered what the challenges of the future are. These changes need to be institutionally and politically translated in order to create and Atlantic community. The Atlantic continues to benefit from a certain institutionalisation of the Atlantic relations. But in the South, emerging powers adopt a strategy of greater autonomy. In the long term, this may be beneficial to other areas, namely to Asia (China). The South Atlantic has emerged as an area of economic prosperity and energy production (Brazil, Nigeria, and Angola, among others). There is a diversification of the type of relations in the Atlantic, not only the traditional North-South but also new relations South-South in which Brazil has been playing a very important role. We are seeing the emergence of a new pan-Atlantic system of relations in the Atlantic Basin, far beyond the two traditional relations in the Atlantic: the alliance between Europe and the US and the traditional dependence North-South. &nbsp;However, according to Nuno S. Teixeira, a new pan-Atlantic system of relations is a vision, but it is a vision without a strategy. It is a vision without the instruments of multilateral institutionalisation of the system of these new relations. Something that is absolutely fundamental for future cooperation. According to him, this is the main challenge we face today and our aim with this project is to try to contribute to this vision and to this strategy, trying to build an Atlantic unity for the future.<\/p>\r\n<p>Jordi Bacaria presented the Atlantic Future project, highlighting the European Commission funding and support in the research. Jordi Bacaria overviewed the project with the main outputs and the work ahead. He placed the project and the Atlantic in the context of latest developments such as the negotiations of the TTIP or the creation of the Development Bank.<\/p>\r\n<p>Dan Hamilton started his intervention by pointing that there is a lot more going on in the Atlantic space that is generally understood. Globalisation is not limited to the Pacific. Most of the media and political discourse seems to conflate what is going on in Asia (mainly China) with globalisation. Hamilton clarified that both are much related, but globalisation does not only happen in China. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>To support his statement he highlighted a few key areas. The Atlantic provides as much energy to the world as the Middle East, and the trends in the Atlantic are much more dynamic. In trade, the Atlantic is still where most trade takes place. Trade and goods are still very strong in the North Atlantic, and also between South American and Europe and South America and North America. South-South exchanges are still the weakest, though it is true that these are the most dynamic. Demand is going to find a new way, and ports are scrambling to take on big tankers. An example of that, Dan Hamilton, mentioned how &nbsp;Houston-Texas, has become the largest city export in the US. &ldquo;People in Texas think they are Atlantic&rdquo;, said Hamilton. Trade in goods is getting increasingly Pacific; however, services are a more Atlantic phenomenon, especially in the North Atlantic, and investment is still an Atlantic phenomenon. Finally, Dan Hamilton added that the expansion of the Panama Canal and the melting of the Arctic are creating new transportation passages.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/837-1430296596.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Albeit these are the most prominent areas, Dan Hamilton considered that other areas are &nbsp;also worth exploring: 1) the Atlantic Ocean, as there are issues that are specific to the Atlantic Ocean. Globalisation dynamics are creating all sorts of new challenges such as rising sea levels in the Atlantic coast faster than anywhere else, pollution, overfishing where no regimes to take care for the full Atlantic, with no governance structures, among many others; 2) Maritime securities; and 3) Challenges to human security. He further referred to values in the Atlantic. In his view, there is no contestation of values in the region, as most people in the Atlantic agree and aspire to the same values. Although this does not mean that these are achieved, there is a common type of orientation. In the Pacific, on the contrary, there is much more contestation of values.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">Thus the Atlantic becomes a laboratory. The Atlantic does not have the cleavages of the Pacific, so there is an opportunity to be a laboratory of governance. Beyond the North-South line, the Atlantic could pave the way and could be a pioneer. This is far beyond where we are today. It is true that disintegrative trends are there but, according to Dan Hamilton, opportunities are here as well. &nbsp;The Atlantic is half of the world. Therefore, if there is an Asian hemisphere, there is also an Atlantic hemisphere. We think of ocean basins, and the connections that those oceans create are a new way of thinking. Hamilton warned that disintegrative trends are the easiest to take us forward. The Atlantic, however, would be poor if we let these tendencies win. This is where the real battle is.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>After the speakers&rsquo; presentation, an interesting debate ensued with the audience. On the United States pivot to the Pacific, Dan Hamilton wondered why the US could not use both vocations: the Atlantic and the Pacific ones. The same happens with Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and all South America. He said that the US is the pivot. It is still so despite relative decline. So from a purely US point of view, the US should enhance the position in the Pacific and also look at the Atlantic. The US has failed to become an Atlantic power and it is instead a North Atlantic power. For Dan Hamilton, the US should reposition itself in this world of diffuse power more pan-Atlantic than in the Pacific. From a security perspective, Dan Hamilton added that the correlation between societal developments, illicit traffic of drugs, humans and weapons with fragile states structure is one of the global challenges of the region -especially in Africa and Latin America. Therefore, he added that transposing institutions for part of the Atlantic Southward is not the way to go.<\/p>\r\n<p>He was asked on legacies in the Atlantic. Victor Borges reflected how there are common features in the Atlantic such as languages or culture, and yet there are also negative things that are still lingering and that reverberates in the present. If these are not managed correctly, these will shape the future. We can see a big picture of homogeneous Atlantic, but we need to go deeper to see the details that can make the difference. The problem is who is going to lead. Whose perspective is going to be placed in the middle to develop this new wider Atlantic? To this reflection, Dan Hamilton added that certainly in the Atlantic we have to deal with legacies. But, he said, continuing in the same mould does not allow us to get beyond this type of thinking. If it is not managed in the right way it is going to backfire us. There is ample opportunity of new infrastructure, there are new things happening and some pioneering work could be done.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/837-1430296475.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Hamilton said that the idea of the Atlantic space will not succeed if it is not shared by people in Brazil, in Africa, etc. It has to be driven &ldquo;by Southern demand&rdquo;, he added. The bigger efforts are in the South more than in the North for this reason. Can we get out of the North-South boxes, even from the BRICS boxes? The Atlantic frame could be a new window to overcome the North\/South way of seeing things, as the traditional frame will no longer work.<\/p>\r\n<p>Asked on the extent to which current and future trade relations will impact on the Atlantic, particularly on the TTIP and its potential disruptive power, seen as the North trying again to exert a leading role, Dan Hamilton pointed that the TTIP is not happening in isolation. A TPP is also being negotiated. He referred to TTIP as another effort to spring loose the multilateral system in another way. By advancing in these areas, it is an assertive effort by US and EU that should work for everyone. The question is whether it is open: leaders have not said that this is open to others, and this is the mistake. They have said it in the Pacific, but not for the TTIP. It is about the norms, standards, rules, that will guide us into the future, he added.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hamilton referred to the importance of a non-governmental approach. In the world we face, the public-private network is more relevant than state to state. Despite differences, he said, things can be done. Years ago people looked at Pacific and thought that something could be done, and as a result nowadays APEC exists. The Pacific is a much more diverse region with greater challenges than the Atlantic. There could be different forms of collaboration in the Atlantic. Networks become the more relevant angle to look at some of the current challenges. There is an opportunity to explore.<\/p>\r\n<p>Jordi Bacaria finished by adding that the Atlantic Future project itself tries to build epistemic communities. He reflected on the fact that if all projects are born in the North, we will have a Northern perspective. We need to have more projects in the South, he said. Otherwise, the perspective will always be North Atlantic. Nevertheless, he also pointed out that this is changing.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>After the public debate, the seminar continued with a roundtable with Maria Raquel Freire (University of Coimbra), Tiago Moreira de S&aacute; and Emanuel Joaquim (IPRI). The experts presented their research on Russian foreign policy and on the US and the Azores, and elaborated on the implications for the Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/837-1430296622.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>","views":"297","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-04-29 10:24:00","modified":"2016-02-08 04:24:10"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"130","content_id":"837","type":"1","file_name":"837-Lisboa_Setting the Grounds_public event.pdf","description":"Public event report","created":"2015-04-29 10:25:35","modified":"2015-04-29 10:25:35"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"5246","content_id":"837","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"5240","content_id":"837","tag_id":"108","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"108","code":"energy","name":"Energy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:45","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:45"}},{"id":"5241","content_id":"837","tag_id":"16","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"5242","content_id":"837","tag_id":"187","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"187","code":"transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership","name":"transatlantic trade and investment partnership","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"5243","content_id":"837","tag_id":"186","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"186","code":"ttip","name":"ttip","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"5244","content_id":"837","tag_id":"2","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"2","code":"laboratory","name":"Laboratory","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:04:01","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:01"}},{"id":"5245","content_id":"837","tag_id":"6","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"6","code":"globalisation","name":"Globalisation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:03:52","modified":"2013-09-27 10:03:52"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"5246","content_id":"837","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"784","code":"atlantic-future-at-the-heart-of-academic-","user_id":"1","title":"Atlantic Future at the heart of academic ","abstract":"Frank Mattheis, from the&nbsp;Centre for the study of Governance Innovation (GovInn) atthe University of Pretoria,and member of the FP7 project &ldquo;Atlantic Future&rdquo;, attended three conferences organized by GISA (German Institute of Global and Area Studies), &nbsp;ISA (International Studies Association), and EUSA (European Union Studies Association) in representation of the project.","body":"<p>The conferences took place in Hambury (Germany), New Orleanas (USA) and Boston (USA), respectively.<\/p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.giga-hamburg.de\/en\/event\/world-regions-compared-polity-politics-and-policy\">World Regions Compared: Polity, Politics, and Policy\" at the German Institute &nbsp;

An interview with Jordi Vaquer i Fan&eacute;s, Director of the Open Society Initiative for Europe and Associate Senior Researcher of CIDOB.","body":"<p><em>Jordi Vaquer is the director of the Open Society Initiative for Europe and the regional director for Europe at the Open Society Foundations. In these positions, he works to advance the values and institutions of open society in the cities and countries of the European Union and the Western Balkans. Vaquer writes and provides commentary for Spanish media, and often speaks at international debates and seminars on international affairs and EU politics. Before becoming director of the Open Society Initiative for Europe, Vaquer was director of the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs, one of southern Europe&rsquo;s most influential international relations think tanks and Coordinator of the Atlantic Future project. Vaquer graduated from the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; received an MA from the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium; and completed a PhD in international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What does the ATLANTIC FUTURE project refer to with the expression &lsquo;Atlantic Space&rsquo;? Why should we think about the Atlantic in those terms?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A:&nbsp; The research focus of the Atlantic Future project is not self-evident. The Atlantic is an ocean, not an integrated region in any re&shy;cognizable shape; and it is not where the fo&shy;cus of international relations is, by contrast with the Arctic, the Indian Ocean and, above all, the Pacific. And yet, the space where Afri&shy;ca, the Americas and Europe meet remains one of crucial importance for Global Gover&shy;nance. The Atlantic perhaps exemplifies North\/South dynamics better than any other macro-region. It contains many of the difficulties and challenges of Global Governance; but, to address them, it can build on historical, cultural, linguistic and ideological links that cannot be compa&shy;red to those in any other Ocean basin. The weight of its past is an obstacle, but can also serve as a launching pad for future cooperation. And all Atlantic powers (from the US, the EU and Brazil, to the small littoral states of West Africa and the Caribbean) have an interest in not seeing the Atlantic become a backwater of global trade, and in maximizing the hitherto overlooked potential of their Atlantic links. These are all good reasons to take a serious, in depth look at the Atlantic space as an interlinked whole.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;To think about an Atlantic space is neither an exercise in wishful thinking, nor a nor&shy;mative endeavour. Atlantic Future as an intellectual project is an invi&shy;tation to lateral thinking and unusual re&shy;search, to take the less beaten track and ask the unexpected questions, to highlight the almost invisible connections and interpret the emerging trends. The research is teaching us about the four continents that border it, and about their links; at the same time, we are learning about Globalization, and the results may point towards possible roads to better global governance.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Which do you consider to be the trends that could shape the emergence of an Atlantic Space?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: The global redistribution of power affects the Atlantic space as much as any other part of the World. The emergence of the South holds the promise of a radical re-equilibrium for the whole Atlantic, with new opportunities for growth and exchange in all directions and, potentially, plenty of space for win-win situations. The pivot of the gravity centre of global geoeconomics towards Asia, on the contrary, represents a challenge to a space that was, for a long time, at the centre of Globalisation. Another trend is the emergence of new forms of regionalism in Africa and Latin America, less shaped by the EU model, and in a context where countries are rapidly abandoning old, post-colonial dependency relationships and developing multi-vector strategies (towards North America and Europe, but also towards East Asia, South Asia, inside the regions themselves, and across the southern Atlantic).<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Which areas for potential regional cooperation do you envisage for the Atlantic?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: &nbsp;The three areas with most potential for cooperation that I see are security, food production and environmental governance. In the area of security, the Atlantic space has a number of grey spaces &ndash; whether it is fragile states like Haiti and Guinea Bissau, weak states like Mauritania and Honduras that struggle to control violent groups, or even black holes of insecurity inside relatively large and powerful countries such as Mexico and Nigeria &ndash; where different kinds of mostly unconventional security risks (terrorism, drug traffic, violent crime and piracy) flourish. In food production, the Atlantic regions combined (the Americas, Africa and Europe) hold the key to addressing food security at global scale, but they have to find the ways to do it without intolerable ecologic impact. Finally, environmental governance is an urgent issue that cannot be delayed. From the preservation of fisheries to climate change, from biodiversity to chemical pollution of the oceans, the Atlantic could pioneer the solutions to a range of environmental issues.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"154","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"1","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-03-13 12:12:00","modified":"2016-02-07 19:01:30"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"116","content_id":"481","type":"1","file_name":"481-ATLANTIC VOICES_01.pdf","description":"Atlantic Voices.

Atlantic: Drivers of change","abstract":"\r\n\r\n\r\nBrussels\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Feb.&nbsp;24, 2015, the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF)&nbsp;Brussels office, in collaboration with the Barcelona Center for International Affairs (CIDOB), the Ecologic Institute, Aberystwyth University, and the Foundation for International Relations and External Dialogue (FRIDE)&nbsp;co-hosted a roundtable discussion&nbsp;on new perspectives on the Atlantic space. Entitled&nbsp;&ldquo;The Atlantic: Drivers of Change&rdquo;, the event took place within a three-year collaborative research project funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme, entitled &ldquo;Towards an Atlantic area? Mapping trends, perspectives and interregional dynamics between Europe, Africa and the Americas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","body":"<p>The discussion kicked&nbsp;off with short presentations on new research findings which analyzed&nbsp;the changes occurring in the Atlantic basin with respect to energy, maritime security, and economic governance. It was argued that there is a high degree of fragmentation within the Atlantic space due to the&nbsp;growing importance of new actors and agendas. While opportunities and challenges exist when it comes to regional cooperation, there was a general consensus that there is a need for integrated&nbsp;policy strategies.<\/p>\r\n<p>Countries along the Atlantic basin have strong bases for&nbsp;cooperation -&nbsp;including language, democratic institutions, and cultural proximity -&nbsp;which are all driving factors for cooperation in the Atlantic. It was noted that a new era of energy may be found in the pan-Atlantic space, as it has the potential to drive the future of energy with its large capacity vis-&agrave;-vis renewable energy. With the expansion of new energy infrastructures in the pan-Atlantic space, this could also lead to market development as it has already caught the attention of Chinese and Indian investments.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>On maritime security, the discussion highlighted key&nbsp;threats; drug trafficking, organised crime, and piracy, all of&nbsp;which are becoming increasingly interlinked. Governments in both the South and the&nbsp;North see these threats as obstacles for cooperation but have not been able to adequately address the threat, which also carries economic costs for surrounding countries. Therefore,&nbsp;importance of cooperation to cope with maritime security issues was stressed.<\/p>\r\n<p>The discussion concluded with a discussion on the impact of the pending Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which was seen as vital in &nbsp;respect to the way the world is developing. Concerns were also raised about Europe and the U.S. becoming global economic leaders and to what degree they would provide a regulatory framework for others to follow &ndash; or whether some countries may be excluded.<\/p>\r\n<p><a

It will also suggest strategies for how the EU&nbsp;can engage with the wider transatlantic relationship in the context of the ongoing redistribution of power and the overall rebalancing of relations around and within the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p>This conversation&nbsp;will explore what economic and geostrategic implications the energy revolution in the Atlantic will&nbsp;entail for regional integration and what kind of regional cooperation could be pursued in order to tackle international security challenges. We will examine the proliferations of trade agreements in the Atlantic, &ldquo;barriers&rdquo; or &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo; for new models of governance in the region, and finally what the role of the European Union in the Atlantic region should&nbsp;be.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Please confirm your attendance to <a href=\"mailto:bmedroa@gmfus.org\">bmedroa@gmfus.org<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/463-1424259344.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme under the grant agreement n&deg; [320091].<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/463-1424353239.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/463-1424353259.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/463-1424353325.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/463-1424353650.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 21.9200000762939px;\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/463-1424353854.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"211","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"1","created":"2015-02-24 10:00:00","modified":"2016-02-06 16:07:05"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":"463","datetime":"2015-02-24 10:00:00","country":"Belgium","city":"Brussels","address":"","map":""},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"5026","content_id":"463","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"5021","content_id":"463","tag_id":"137","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"137","code":"european-union","name":"European Union","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:16:06","modified":"2013-10-25 10:16:06"}},{"id":"5022","content_id":"463","tag_id":"5","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"5","code":"atlantic-space","name":"Atlantic space","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:55:08","modified":"2013-09-27 09:55:08"}},{"id":"5023","content_id":"463","tag_id":"24","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"24","code":"political-relations","name":"Political relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:04:54","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:54"}},{"id":"5024","content_id":"463","tag_id":"147","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"147","code":"international-relations","name":"international relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-11-18 11:32:59","modified":"2013-11-18 11:32:59"}},{"id":"5025","content_id":"463","tag_id":"36","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"36","code":"events","name":"Events","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"995B31","created":"2013-09-27 09:58:37","modified":"2013-09-27 09:58:37"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"5026","content_id":"463","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1110","code":"policy-brief-on-energy-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Policy brief on energy in the Atlantic","abstract":"Profound changes are taking place in the area of energy that are transforming the strategic outlook for the Atlantic Basin.

Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Get&uacute;lio Vargas (FGV) hosted it and representatives of the entire consortium attended to the event. The first day of the meeting consisted of a public event about security issues in the Atlantic region that was held at the Auditorium Engenheiro M. F.

During his intervention the Admiral mentioned that Brazil has a lack of sources of power which makes necessary to prioritize the strategic way to withstand to traditional and non-traditional threats (maritime crime, rivalry of resources, etc.) that have an impact on the Atlantic sea. According to him, the international security context in which the Atlantic interconnections are developing have induced the Brazilian Navy to think and act in terms of dissuasion by denial or punishment as a way to face the conventional or non-conventional threats that makes the Atlantic Sea a strategically area for the country. Up to the point that the Brazilian Navy has decided to invest in the construction of the Nuclear Submarine for the Brazilian Navy.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Admiral's presentation was followed by three sessions dedicated to the analysis of the &ldquo;the global security order and its impact on the Atlantic regional dynamics&rdquo;, &ldquo;the view of the Atlantic Basin as a security area&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Atlantic security as a path to development&rdquo;. These sessions counted with the participation of different partners of the project and some of them were chaired by special invitees such as the Brazilian Captain Alves de Almeida and Victor Borges (member of the Atlantic Future Scientific Panel). Finally, the seminar closed with a roundtable where participants shared views about how the Atlantic has been changing in terms of past alliances and future prospects for the region.<\/p>\r\n<p>Check photos of the Second Plenary Meeting below:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422438518.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422438592.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 21.9200000762939px;\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422438893.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422438963.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422439389.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422439991.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 21.9200000762939px;\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422440031.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">Watch the morning sessions:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-video-container\"><span class=\"pusher\">.<\/span><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yQh10rCpMno?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">Watch the afternoon sessions:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-video-container\"><span class=\"pusher\">.<\/span><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/C6YuC9Exww0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><span class=\"pusher\" style=\"display: inline !important;\">Download the Plenary Meeting&nbsp;report here:<\/span><\/p>","views":"289","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-01-28 10:45:00","modified":"2016-02-08 08:40:18"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"106","content_id":"450","type":"1","file_name":"450-Atlantic Future Project.

It aims to examine perception of governmental policy-openness, likely timescales for policy implementation and perceived attitudes towards potential environmental harm. By mapping out the views of people who work closely with sustainability issues in Atlantic Basin countries, we consider that it is possible to gauge how favourable - as regards principle - and\/or cautious - as regards&nbsp;implementation &ndash; Basin countries are to environmental policy options. Environmental concerns are likely to increase in the future and those who have not had the forethought to invest in sustainability will be faced with ever smaller margins of flexibility. Depending upon how intensively and collectively - or not - sustainability policies are implemented, relations between Atlantic Basin countries will gradually become either conflictual or synergistic. From the GPI&nbsp;we intend to determine the potential roadblocks and points of contention that ought to be considered in the drawing board phase of green policy planning for the Atlantic Basin as a whole. It ought to be noted, however, that although we are working with the hypothesis that the polling of SD experts on sustainable policies will yield useful material, this research should be viewed as a pilot investigation into the desirability of producing the GPI on a more regular basis.&nbsp;In short, we aim to discover whether it is possible to collect and present useful information on green policy by polling SD experts, and, if so, whether various stakeholders would support the development and\/or deployment of an annual survey to capture the full spectrum of green policy perception.<\/p>","views":"361","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 15:09:00","modified":"2016-01-31 09:41:31"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"97","content_id":"339","type":"1","file_name":"339-ATLANTIC FUTURE_18_Sustainable Policy Perceptions in the Atlantic Basin.compressed.pdf","description":"Sustainable Policy Perceptions in the Atlantic Basin","created":"2014-12-05 14:26:04","modified":"2014-12-05 14:26:04"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4246","content_id":"339","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"4241","content_id":"339","tag_id":"43","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"43","code":"policy","name":"Policy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:04:43","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:43"}},{"id":"4242","content_id":"339","tag_id":"109","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"109","code":"environment","name":"Environment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:06:53","modified":"2013-09-27 11:06:53"}},{"id":"4243","content_id":"339","tag_id":"167","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"167","code":"fundacao-getulio-vargas-fgv-rio-de-janeiro","name":"funda\u00e7ao get\u00falio vargas (fgv) rio de janeiro","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4244","content_id":"339","tag_id":"168","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"168","code":"-brazil","name":" brazil","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4245","content_id":"339","tag_id":"150","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4246","content_id":"339","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"338","code":"an-atlantic-energy-renaissance","user_id":"1","title":"An Atlantic energy renaissance","abstract":"ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 17 is out: \"Atlantic Energy and the Changing Global Energy Flow Map\", by Paul Isbell&nbsp;at&nbsp;CTR&nbsp;(Center for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies)","body":"<p>An &lsquo;Atlantic energy renaissance&rsquo; is currently unfolding across the &lsquo;Atlantic Basin,&rsquo; where roughly half of the world&rsquo;s known fossil fuels are located and more than two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s renewable energy is currently generated. The technological revolutions in &lsquo;unconventional&rsquo; and &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; hydrocarbons &ndash; in shale and offshore &ndash; have recently contributed to a shift in the global center of gravity of energy supply away from the &lsquo;Great Crescent&rsquo; and into the &lsquo;Atlantic Basin.&rsquo; Combined with the shift in the global center of gravity for demand to emerging Asia-Pacific, these &lsquo;revolutions&rsquo; are reversing the traditional &lsquo;westward&rsquo; flow of energy from Eurasia to the Atlantic to produce a new pattern of global flows in which the countries of the Atlantic Basin will increasingly become the net suppliers of energy at the margin to Asia-Pacific. Furthermore, such &lsquo;revolutions&rsquo; have also played a role in the recent reversal of fortunes of renewable energy, particularly in the Northern Atlantic. Therefore, while shifting energy flow map &ndash; largely driven by the Atlantic energy renaissance &ndash; both calls into question the notion of the &lsquo;Asian century&rsquo; and problematizes the rationale behind the US &lsquo;pivot to Asia,&rsquo; it also reveals new geopolitical and governance potential along the strategic horizon for Atlantic actors. However, such potential&nbsp;will remain unrealized without &lsquo;pan-Atlantic energy cooperation that addresses both the emerging issues of the new &lsquo;energy seascape&rsquo; and the low carbon &lsquo;imperative.&rsquo; Finally, the &lsquo;Atlantic energy renaissance&rsquo; and the changing global energy flow map of which it is both cause and effect, also highlights the growing relative strategic significance of the &lsquo;Southern Atlantic&rsquo;.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"1090","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 15:06:00","modified":"2016-02-08 16:04:31"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"77","content_id":"338","type":"1","file_name":"338-ATLANTIC FUTURE_17_Energy.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 17: \u201cAtlantic Energy and the Changing Global Energy Flow Map\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 15:08:02","modified":"2014-09-29 15:08:02"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4101","content_id":"338","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"4094","content_id":"338","tag_id":"108","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"108","code":"energy","name":"Energy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:45","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:45"}},{"id":"4095","content_id":"338","tag_id":"162","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"162","code":"resources","name":"resources","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4096","content_id":"338","tag_id":"1","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"1","code":"atlantic-basin","name":"Atlantic Basin","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:54:32","modified":"2013-09-27 09:54:32"}},{"id":"4097","content_id":"338","tag_id":"126","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"126","code":"cooperation","name":"Cooperation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:21:56","modified":"2013-09-30 10:21:56"}},{"id":"4098","content_id":"338","tag_id":"125","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"125","code":"johns-hopkins-university-jhu","name":"Johns Hopkins University (JHU)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:19:12","modified":"2013-09-30 10:19:12"}},{"id":"4099","content_id":"338","tag_id":"15","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"4100","content_id":"338","tag_id":"150","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4101","content_id":"338","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"337","code":"climate-change-impacts-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Climate change impacts in the Atlantic","abstract":"[Photo Credit: Reuters File Photo]\r\n&nbsp;\r\nATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 16 is out: \"Climate change impacts in the Atlantic Basin and coordinated adaptation responses\", by Christoph Stefes, Andrew Reid, Lucy Smith, and Elizabeth Tedsen at&nbsp;Ecologic Institute","body":"<p>The need for ambitious implementation of strategies and measures for climate adaptation has become clear, however, at a global level, it is uncertain if or whether the issue is best confronted by centralised or fragmented structures of adaptation governance. This paper, an output of the EU ATLANTIC FUTURE project, investigates the dynamic network of transnational climate adaptation institutions currently working in the Atlantic Basin region. From a broad pool of adaptation institutions present in the Atlantic, eight case studies were selected and investigated, together representing an array of regions, forms of cooperation, actors, and thematic issues. Through case study analysis, this paper considers whether the work undertaken by these institutions is uniquely &lsquo;Atlantic&rsquo; in nature &ndash; that is, if and how they are driven, facilitated, or bounded by the specific actors, climate impacts, or characteristics of the region &ndash; or whether they are more global in nature. Secondly, we examine how these institutions fit within the larger picture of fragmented global climate adaptation governance. In doing so, we find indications that the Atlantic hosts and fosters a diverse and active array of institutions, but that these are largely focused on the production and exchange of scientific knowledge and capacity building, rather than on the implementation of concrete measures. Although the fragmented governance structure currently in place has produced much valuable work, increased centralisation could be beneficial for ensuring better coordination and implementation of adaptation activities at the ground level.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"630","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 15:03:00","modified":"2016-02-07 05:16:14"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"76","content_id":"337","type":"1","file_name":"337-ATLANTIC FUTURE_16_Climate change impacts in the Atlantic Basin.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 16: \u201cClimate change impacts in the Atlantic Basin and coordinated adaptation responses\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 15:03:30","modified":"2014-09-29 15:03:30"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4398","content_id":"337","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"4393","content_id":"337","tag_id":"107","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"107","code":"climate-change","name":"Climate change","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:29","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:29"}},{"id":"4394","content_id":"337","tag_id":"88","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"88","code":"governance","name":"Governance","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:55:35","modified":"2013-09-27 10:55:35"}},{"id":"4395","content_id":"337","tag_id":"109","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"109","code":"environment","name":"Environment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:06:53","modified":"2013-09-27 11:06:53"}},{"id":"4396","content_id":"337","tag_id":"124","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"124","code":"ecologic-institute-gmbh-ecologic","name":"Ecologic Institute GmbH (ECOLOGIC)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-02 14:28:09","modified":"2013-12-02 14:28:09"}},{"id":"4397","content_id":"337","tag_id":"150","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4398","content_id":"337","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"336","code":"marine-resources-and-coastal-livelihoods","user_id":"1","title":"Marine resources and coastal livelihoods","abstract":"ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 15 is out: \"Marine resource management and coastal livelihoods: an Atlantic perspective\", by Elizabeth Tedsen, Benjamin Boteler, Katriona McGlade, Tanja&nbsp;Srebotnjak, and Katrina Abhold at&nbsp;Ecologic Institute","body":"<p>Marine ecosystem resources play important roles in coastal countries, providing numerous benefits and services.

This organization was built on the shared history and language of its eight member states &ndash; Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao&nbsp;Tome and Principe and Timor-Leste &ndash; and has recently attracted the interest of many states in and out of the Atlantic Basin. In this context, language is one of the assets allowing this organization to increase its international projection and attractiveness. Notwithstanding, it is also true that recent power configurations in the South Atlantic &ndash; with energy and security matters&nbsp;at its core &ndash; has also contributed to increasing the CPLP&rsquo;s &lsquo;magnetism&rsquo;. Hence, we argue that language has allowed the CPLP to project soft power (through the pivotal role played by the governments of Portugal and Brazil), but that language itself has in turn benefited from the economic attractiveness of the organization. Many states in and out of the Atlantic Basin now perceive the CPLP as a relevant forum through which they can reach the &lsquo;Lusophone world&rsquo;.

The means of tracking migration, of regulating it, and of requesting migrants&rsquo; political and cultural commitment to their host countries have shifted with global economic reconfigurations. Before proceeding to global patterns and concerns around migration and a brief overview of the history of the Atlantic basin as a social space structured by mobility, I reflect on the conceptual tools and analytic strategies which current quantitative sources on human mobility take for granted. For example, historical trajectories and political context are absent from the analyses. Policy driven databases produced by various agencies of international governance afford a vast yet superficial grasp of global mobility patterns, which can be complemented and complicated through smaller scale and longitudinal projects that provide qualitative depth to our understanding of human mobility. Human movement is crucially structured by economic differentials and opportunity, but also by shared colonial histories that sowed specific linguistic skills and social aspirations as they unified political boundaries.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"369","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 14:02:00","modified":"2016-02-08 11:10:54"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"73","content_id":"331","type":"1","file_name":"331-ATLANTIC FUTURE_13_Geometries of Human Mobility in the Atlantic Space.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 13: \u201cGeometries of Human Mobility in the Atlantic Space\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 14:02:53","modified":"2014-09-29 14:02:53"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4127","content_id":"331","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},{"id":"4123","content_id":"331","tag_id":"94","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"94","code":"migration","name":"Migration","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:57:01","modified":"2013-09-27 10:57:01"}},{"id":"4124","content_id":"331","tag_id":"227","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"227","code":"mobility","name":"mobility","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4125","content_id":"331","tag_id":"153","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

Development cooperation is indicative of broader shifts in political, economic, and cultural clout and key elements of the global aid architecture are adapting a new reality. In light of South-South Cooperation&rsquo;s emergence as an alternative to traditional aid, the analysis of cooperation in the Atlantic Basin points to an increasingly diverse global South. The diversity, in turn could position the Atlantic as a laboratory for innovative approaches to development cooperation. In the foreseeable future, interaction among Atlantic development partners, whether through cooperation, coordination, or competition, is unlikely to be crystalized into a new institutional set-up but will rather become the sum of dynamic and flexible arrangements reflecting the diversity of actors, interests, and strategies.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"454","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 13:56:00","modified":"2016-02-08 14:09:44"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"71","content_id":"329","type":"1","file_name":"329-ATLANTIC FUTURE_11_Development in the Atlantic.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 11: \u201cDevelopment in the Atlantic: Between cooperation and competition\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 13:57:14","modified":"2014-09-29 13:57:14"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4138","content_id":"329","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},{"id":"4134","content_id":"329","tag_id":"126","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"126","code":"cooperation","name":"Cooperation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:21:56","modified":"2013-09-30 10:21:56"}},{"id":"4135","content_id":"329","tag_id":"15","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"4136","content_id":"329","tag_id":"157","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"157","code":"german-marshall-fund","name":"german marshall fund","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4137","content_id":"329","tag_id":"150","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4138","content_id":"329","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"328","code":"ideas--norms-and-principles-","user_id":"1","title":"Ideas, Norms and Principles ","abstract":"ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 10 is out: \"Convergence or Divergence of Ideas, Norms, and Principles in the Atlantic?

In other words whether the idea of a &lsquo;pan-Atlantic area&rsquo; is a viable political, social, and cultural concept. More specifically, it explores whether or not the Atlantic space can be characterized as an area of normative convergence. To do so the paper employs insights from the literatures on policy convergence and policy transfer and in particular the &lsquo;soft&rsquo; transfer of policy inputs through transnational networks. Rather than attempt to map the intangible transfer of ideas, norms, and principles across the Atlantic space, the approach taken here is to map the structures through which soft transfer can potentially take place. An analysis of online survey&nbsp;data from 150 environmental NGOs based in Europe, Africa and the Americas reveals a concentration of transnational networks within the Atlantic space, which could potentially contribute to the convergence of ideas, norms, and principles in the area. In this way, the paper argues that the pattern of transnational networks observed provides some supporting evidence of the emergence of an Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"201","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 13:54:00","modified":"2016-01-31 12:55:00"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"70","content_id":"328","type":"1","file_name":"328-ATLANTIC FUTURE_10_Convergence or Divergence of Ideas Norms and Principles.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 10: \"Convergence or Divergence of Ideas, Norms, and Principles in the Atlantic?

The changing&nbsp;geopolitical context in the Atlantic basin and globally is redefining power relations and questioning dominant policy approaches. This is creating new political space and opportunities for Southern Atlantic actors to develop their own institutional frameworks for South-South dialogue and cooperation, distinct from Northern dominated political, economic and security structures, and allow them to develop autonomous options to address common fragility trends, &lsquo;among equals&rsquo;. The geopolitical reality of the Atlantic basin is however far more complex. It extends beyond the Atlantic regions and develops in parallel tracks of competition and cooperation along North-South and South-South asymmetries and convergence. Shared interest and concerns over the impact of fragility and in specific fragile contexts provide an opportunity to test whether and how Atlantic diversity can generate new momentum and more effective approaches to address fragility in the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"342","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"1","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 12:47:00","modified":"2016-02-06 20:02:55"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"92","content_id":"327","type":"1","file_name":"327-ATLANTIC FUTURE_09_Fragiles states.compressed.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 9: \"Fragile States: Challenges and Opportunities for Atlantic Relations\"","created":"2014-10-09 10:17:26","modified":"2014-10-09 10:17:26"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4216","content_id":"327","tag_id":"21","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},{"id":"4211","content_id":"327","tag_id":"130","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"130","code":"human-security","name":"Human security","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-10 11:59:29","modified":"2013-10-10 11:59:29"}},{"id":"4212","content_id":"327","tag_id":"15","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"4213","content_id":"327","tag_id":"140","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"4214","content_id":"327","tag_id":"157","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"157","code":"german-marshall-fund","name":"german marshall fund","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4215","content_id":"327","tag_id":"150","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4216","content_id":"327","tag_id":"21","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"326","code":"transnational-threats-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Transnational threats in the Atlantic","abstract":"ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 8 is out: \"Significant Trends in Illicit Trafficking: A Macro View of the Problem and Potential Means to Address It\", by Dr. Mark R.

By examining general trends in these illicit industries, in addition to several country-specific and regional cases, a framework for an overall counter trafficking strategy can be developed.

Far from being homogeneous, the Atlantic Basin combines different historical and cultural backgrounds, diverse natural features, and distinct levels of development. While these favour numerous&nbsp;economic and political opportunities, they may represent an obstacle in tackling maritime security issues. Through the present study, maritime border disputes are identified and mapped, and a further analysis about its impacts on interstate relations is developed. We conclude that, although there are obstacles fostering cooperation on maritime security, such cooperation is becoming increasingly relevant to the North and South Atlantic in terms of management of territorial disputes, impacts of climate change, resource protection, regulation of the maritime system and prevention of international crime.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"258","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 12:42:00","modified":"2016-02-01 16:23:29"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"67","content_id":"325","type":"1","file_name":"325-ATLANTIC FUTURE_07_Maritime Security in the Atlantic.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 7: \"Maritime Territorial Delimitation and Maritime Security in the Atlantic\"","created":"2014-09-29 12:43:46","modified":"2014-09-29 12:43:46"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4167","content_id":"325","tag_id":"21","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},{"id":"4163","content_id":"325","tag_id":"167","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"167","code":"fundacao-getulio-vargas-fgv-rio-de-janeiro","name":"funda\u00e7ao get\u00falio vargas (fgv) rio de janeiro","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4164","content_id":"325","tag_id":"168","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"168","code":"-brazil","name":" brazil","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4165","content_id":"325","tag_id":"208","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"208","code":"maritime-security","name":"maritime security","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4166","content_id":"325","tag_id":"150","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4167","content_id":"325","tag_id":"21","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"324","code":"the-atlantic-as-a-new-security-area","user_id":"1","title":"The Atlantic as a new security area?","abstract":"ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 6 is out: \"The Atlantic as a new security area?

Far less has involved cooperation between more disparate actors, such as those representing either side of the North and South economic divide. This paper thus seeks to explore nascent trends in North&ndash;South security cooperation in Africa&rsquo;s Atlantic region, with a particular focus on the regions represented by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS). Is an Atlantic area for cooperation forming? Some progress in domains such as maritime security is already discernible. This paper also identifies further areas for cooperation.

Khorana at Keele University","body":"<p>This paper asks what is required to develop resurgence in trade and economic integration in the Atlantic economy. It does this by examining the factors that have led to growth in the past and examines the current network of transport links; in particular maritime networks. The paper outlines demand and supply based drivers. It finds on the demand side that the growth of national GDP&rsquo;s has led not only to an increase in goods transported but also to a change in the composition of those goods. Growing GDP has also influenced the mode of transport used to&nbsp;carry goods. Other demand side factors that have influenced the growth of trade include lower trade barriers as a result of trade agreements; the entry into the world economy of former centrally planned command economies as well as the emerging BRICS and NICs and the operations of multinational companies. On the supply side the main influence in promoting networks include the decline in transportation costs brought about by technological changes affecting ships and aircraft coupled with the increase in investment in sea ports and airports as well as the associated development of hub and spoke networks. The development and use of the internet connections has also boosted trade in goods. To regenerate the Atlantic economy will require inter-governmental cooperation to develop economic and political institutions to facilitate economic integration and growth and improve transport networks in the Atlantic economic space.<\/p>","views":"185","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-23 12:54:00","modified":"2016-02-06 02:13:49"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"65","content_id":"311","type":"1","file_name":"311-ATLANTIC FUTURE_05_Technology, Trade and Changes in Transport in the.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 5: \"Technology, Trade and Changes in Transport in the Atlantic Space\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:55:27","modified":"2014-09-23 12:55:27"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"7296","content_id":"311","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"7292","content_id":"311","tag_id":"78","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"78","code":"transport","name":"Transport","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:52:35","modified":"2013-09-27 10:52:35"}},{"id":"7293","content_id":"311","tag_id":"161","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"161","code":"maritime-transport","name":"maritime transport","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7294","content_id":"311","tag_id":"16","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"7295","content_id":"311","tag_id":"150","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"7296","content_id":"311","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"310","code":"global-value-chains-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Global Value Chains in the Atlantic","abstract":"ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 4 is out: \"Global Value Chains in the Atlantic Space\", by Mariana Magaldi de Sousa and Elsy Gonzalez Cubr&iacute;a at&nbsp;CIDE","body":"<p>Global value chains (GVCs) have revolutionized trade. Countries no longer have to produce a particular product from scratch; all they must do is insert themselves into an existing chain of production that often spreads across several countries. Nevertheless, insertion into a global value chain has become a real challenge. Economies that are not able to successfully insert&nbsp;themselves into multiple GVCs are likely to reduce their opportunities for industrialization and economic growth. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which countries in the Atlantic Space have inserted themselves into GVCs in the past two decades. It draws on an original dataset of trade patterns by stage of production and value added that spans from 1995 to 2012, collected from the UN COMTRADE databank and the OECD-WTO Trade in Value Added (TiVA) dataset. It finds that despite some interesting cross-country variation, participation in GVCs is still generally low. The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we review the concept of value chain participation and alternative methodologies for measuring it. Section 3 provides a panoramic view of trade flows in the Atlantic, and Section 4 focuses on empirical evidence of GVC participation in two case studies (Mexico and Brazil). Section 5 briefly assesses the available information on trade in value added in selected countries of the Atlantic space and the last Section concludes.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"344","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-23 12:50:00","modified":"2016-02-05 16:19:15"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"64","content_id":"310","type":"1","file_name":"310-ATLANTIC FUTURE_04_Global Value Chains in the Atlantic Space.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 4: \"Global value chains in the Atlantic Space\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:50:39","modified":"2014-09-23 12:50:39"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4182","content_id":"310","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"4179","content_id":"310","tag_id":"16","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"4180","content_id":"310","tag_id":"153","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

Khorana at Keele University","body":"<p>This paper conceptualises how trade governance is evolving within regional trading agreements (RTAs) in the Atlantic Space. Two main research questions are posed: Can Atlantic Space agreements connect the bilateral and multilateral trade frameworks and contribute to a new framework on global trade governance? What are the areas of convergence and divergence between RTAs negotiated in the Atlantic Space and the WTO Agreements? Findings reveal that: firstly, trade liberalisation commitments undertaken with in the Atlantic Space by partner countries are driven by the aim of achieving convergence on trade rules between RTAs with WTO Agreements. Some agreements are, however, aspirational in nature. Second, the degree of trade governance convergence between Atlantic space trading arrangements and the WTO Agreements depends on the level of partner countries&rsquo; development and their integration into the world economy, suggesting that RTAs with countries that are well integrated into the world economy tend to exhibit greater convergence to WTO Agreements. However, there is a clear trend of an overlap between RTAs and WTO Agreements which can be interpreted to mean that regional agreements could support the Atlantic Space&rsquo;s role as a global actor to shape a functioning multilateral order.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"249","shares":"1","tweets":"4","mails":"1","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-23 12:44:00","modified":"2016-02-06 03:24:44"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"63","content_id":"309","type":"1","file_name":"309-ATLANTIC FUTURE_03_Multilateral Agreements and Global Governance of International Trade Regimes.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 3: \"Multilateral Agreements and Global Governance of International Trade Regimes\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:45:22","modified":"2014-09-23 12:45:22"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4190","content_id":"309","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"4187","content_id":"309","tag_id":"88","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"88","code":"governance","name":"Governance","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:55:35","modified":"2013-09-27 10:55:35"}},{"id":"4188","content_id":"309","tag_id":"165","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"165","code":"aberystwyth-university-wales-uk","name":"Aberystwyth University Wales (UK)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-01-15 10:50:33","modified":"2014-01-15 10:50:33"}},{"id":"4189","content_id":"309","tag_id":"150","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4190","content_id":"309","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"308","code":"commercial-ties-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Commercial ties in the Atlantic","abstract":"ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 2 is out: \"Commercial Ties in the Atlantic Basin: The Evolving Role of Services and Investment\", by Daniel S.

Services are the sleeping giant of the pan-Atlantic economy. The Atlantic is home to the world's major services economies; Atlantic economies are each other's most important services markets; and Atlantic economies are poised to be major beneficiaries and drivers of the growth in global services. Services are not just a North Atlantic story; they represent a growing area of commercial activity among Southern Atlantic countries as well, particularly in energy related services; engineering and construction services; and education and managerial services. The United States and Europe are global leaders as outward investors and recipients. But today a rising global share of FDI emanates from the developing nations. And whereas trade and investment ties, and bank lending, between these nations and Africa and South and Central America were once shallow and underdeveloped, such linkages are now thicker, more robust and more sophisticated, particularly from China. But the EU remains the largest source of FDI on all Atlantic continents. It is also the largest holder of portfolio assets in North America. Its assets in Africa are roughly equal to those of Asia. North America accounted for over half of South and Central America's portfolio holdings in 2012, with the EU the only other major asset holder. South and Central America's holdings in North America and Europe grew rapidly over the past decade, although from a low base. All told, the Atlantic Hemisphere accounted for 83.8% of EU portfolio assets and 70.2% of North American portfolio assets in 2012.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"253","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-23 12:27:00","modified":"2016-02-03 21:19:29"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"61","content_id":"308","type":"1","file_name":"308-ATLANTIC FUTURE_02_Commercial ties in the Atlantic Basin.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 2: \"Commercial Ties in the Atlantic Basin:\r\nThe Evolving Role of Services and Investment\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:28:39","modified":"2014-09-23 12:28:39"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4195","content_id":"308","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"4191","content_id":"308","tag_id":"16","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"4192","content_id":"308","tag_id":"160","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"160","code":"investment","name":"investment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4193","content_id":"308","tag_id":"125","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"125","code":"johns-hopkins-university-jhu","name":"Johns Hopkins University (JHU)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:19:12","modified":"2013-09-30 10:19:12"}},{"id":"4194","content_id":"308","tag_id":"150","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4195","content_id":"308","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"305","code":"direct-investment-flows-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Direct investment flows in the Atlantic","abstract":"ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 1 is out: \"Continuities and changes in patterns of direct investment flows between South America and Africa\", by Katarina Pereira da Costa at HEM-CESEM.&nbsp;","body":"<p>The countries of Africa and South America have been experiencing in the last years a substantial growth in their direct investment flows, deepening their integration into the international economy. Recently, we notice the emergence of new partners, who gained weight in Africa and South America direct investments flows, to the detriment of their traditional partners &ndash; the European Union (EU) and the United States (US). Both Africa and South America are diversifying their direct investments towards emerging countries, which includes deepening their own bilateral relationship. The main objective of this paper is to present a general analysis of direct investment relations between South America and Africa, and its relations with the world as well as with the two other important actors in the Atlantic space, the US and the EU. The paper also presents an analysis of Brazilian direct investments in Africa as well as a brief review of South African investments in Brazil.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"231","shares":"1","tweets":"3","mails":"2","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-22 17:02:00","modified":"2016-02-02 17:02:29"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"62","content_id":"305","type":"1","file_name":"305-ATLANTIC FUTURE_01_Continuities and changes in patterns of direct investment flows between South America and Africa.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 1: \"Continuities and changes in patterns of direct investment flows between South America and Africa\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:30:16","modified":"2014-09-23 12:30:16"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4204","content_id":"305","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"4196","content_id":"305","tag_id":"179","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"179","code":"south-africa","name":"South Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:53:06","modified":"2014-04-24 14:53:06"}},{"id":"4197","content_id":"305","tag_id":"140","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"4198","content_id":"305","tag_id":"141","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"141","code":"latin-america","name":"Latin America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:43","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:43"}},{"id":"4199","content_id":"305","tag_id":"149","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"149","code":"institut-des-hautes-etudes-de-management-hem","name":"Institut des Hautes Etudes de Management (HEM)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-02 14:34:30","modified":"2013-12-02 14:34:30"}},{"id":"4200","content_id":"305","tag_id":"68","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"68","code":"foreign-direct-investment","name":"Foreign direct investment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:49:59","modified":"2013-09-27 10:49:59"}},{"id":"4201","content_id":"305","tag_id":"160","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"160","code":"investment","name":"investment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4202","content_id":"305","tag_id":"194","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"194","code":"direct-investment-flows","name":"direct investment flows","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4203","content_id":"305","tag_id":"150","order":"8","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4204","content_id":"305","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"199","code":"an-atlantic-lunch-with-up-students","user_id":"1","title":"An Atlantic lunch with UP students","abstract":"The ATLANTIC FUTURE workshop in Pretoria was organized by GovInn (Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation), University of Pretoria, in June 2014. The workshop took place in the frame of the Governance Innovation Week, a series of seminars, workshops, roundtables and keynote lectures dealing with emerging trends in the field of regional integration, supranational governance, sustainable development, alternative economic thinking and civil society.\r\nAs part of the Workshop, a working lunch with thirty-six prominent UP Young Innovators was held to discuss several issues related to the Atlantic.","body":"<p>As part of the ATLANTIC FUTURE project, GovInn (Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation), University of Pretoria, organised a working lunch on 7 June 2014. Thirty six prominent students or &lsquo;UP Young Innovators&rsquo; were selected to participate. These were international postgraduate students from a variety of different disciplines from across the University, including political science, engineering and the natural sciences.<\/p>\r\n<p>During the working lunch, the students had the opportunity to discuss some of the key themes of the ATLANTIC FUTURE such as security, the environment, institutional cooperation and migration, among others, with Project&rsquo;s senior researchers R. Andreas Kraemer (Ecologic Institute), Camila Pastor (CIDE), In&ecirc;s Sousa (FGV), and Madeleine Goerg (GMF). Each table gathered around 8 to 10 prominent UP Young Innovators.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ATLANTIC FUTURE working lunch started with opening remarks by Jordi Vaquer (CIDOB), in which he presented the ATLANTIC FUTURE project in a global context. The discussions in each of the tables revolved around the following topics:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The table chaired by In&ecirc;s Catarina Pereira da Costa Sousa (FGV) focused on <strong>security in the Atlantic<\/strong>. Far from being homogeneous, the Atlantic Basin combines different historical and cultural backgrounds, diverse natural features, and distinct levels of development. While these favour numerous economic and political opportunities, they may represent an obstacle in tackling maritime security challenges. The maritime security in the Atlantic becomes strategically important to the North and South Atlantic in terms of resources, regulation of maritime system, prevention of international crime, territorial disputes, and control of terrorist activities. The redistribution and rebalancing of power occurring in the world drive the main stakeholders in the region to look at the Atlantic wider region as a potential space of cooperation. However, are the traditional Atlantic Basin powers (the US and the EU) willing to recognise these new actors? The lunchtime discussions addressed this and other related questions. For example, are Atlantic Basin countries willing to make the Atlantic a priority when formulating their foreign policies? Why is it relevant to look at the Atlantic wider structure as a potential source of maritime security cooperation for Africa? Can we identify common strategic security interests in the Atlantic Basin countries?<\/p>\r\n<p>The table chaired by Camila Pastor (CIDE) focused on <strong>migration in the Atlantic<\/strong>. The discussions mainly concerned international migration in the Atlantic basin between 1990 and 2013, as well as the historical patterns characterizing Atlantic mobility that these two decades build on. Current human mobility is reminiscent of the intense Atlantic mobility in the late nineteenth century but the patterns have changed significantly, as have the means of tracking migration, of regulating it, and of requesting migrants&rsquo; political and cultural commitment to their host countries. In addition, the discussions started with a brief overview of the history of the Atlantic basin as a social space structured by mobility and then also focused on global patterns and concerns around migration.<\/p>\r\n<p>The table chaired by Madeleine Goerg (GMF) focused on <strong>institutional cooperation in the Atlantic<\/strong>. The past decade has seen a broad rebalancing of power and a growing assertiveness of the global South. As hierarchies are redefined and interactions between states redrawn, the Atlantic basin brings the enduring dichotomy between North and South into perspective by pointing to nuanced and complex relations in the realm of institutional cooperation. This discussion sought to address some of the key dynamics in institutional cooperation in the Atlantic basin. It tackled questions such as: with the rise of countries like Brazil and South Africa, how have changing economic dynamics impacted existing forms cooperation? In which policy areas is cooperation most desirable and most effective and at which level? What institutional factors, facilitate or hinder cooperation, and what are the main sources of tension and factors for political cooperation in the current context?<\/p>\r\n<p>The table chaired by R. Andreas Kraemer (Ecologic Institute) focused on <strong>shared environmental issues in the Atlantic<\/strong>. R. Andreas Kraemer started the discussion by summarizing the Atlantic-specific, regional dynamics of global environmental challenges. He explained that the pan-Atlantic is not an abstract of international relations, but a biophysical reality. Beyond a shared physical environment, Atlantic Basin countries also share common histories and starting points. The table then attempted to address whether the interconnected Atlantic space helps to resolve, or instead worsen, shared environmental challenges. On the whole, it was thought that there is high potential for inter-Basin cooperation on resource management based on such similarities and on mutual challenges and interests.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Download the report here:<\/p>","views":"441","shares":"1","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-06-14 09:00:00","modified":"2016-02-08 08:10:58"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"59","content_id":"199","type":"1","file_name":"199-Working lunch with UP Young Innovators.pdf","description":"","created":"2014-06-13 13:03:25","modified":"2014-06-13 13:03:25"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"3196","content_id":"199","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"3187","content_id":"199","tag_id":"109","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"109","code":"environment","name":"Environment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:06:53","modified":"2013-09-27 11:06:53"}},{"id":"3188","content_id":"199","tag_id":"26","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"3189","content_id":"199","tag_id":"190","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"190","code":"r-andreas-kraemer","name":"r. andreas kraemer","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3190","content_id":"199","tag_id":"21","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},{"id":"3191","content_id":"199","tag_id":"126","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"126","code":"cooperation","name":"Cooperation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:21:56","modified":"2013-09-30 10:21:56"}},{"id":"3192","content_id":"199","tag_id":"94","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"94","code":"migration","name":"Migration","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:57:01","modified":"2013-09-27 10:57:01"}},{"id":"3193","content_id":"199","tag_id":"5","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"5","code":"atlantic-space","name":"Atlantic space","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:55:08","modified":"2013-09-27 09:55:08"}},{"id":"3194","content_id":"199","tag_id":"189","order":"8","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"189","code":"govinn","name":"govinn","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3195","content_id":"199","tag_id":"178","order":"9","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"178","code":"university-of-pretoria","name":"University of Pretoria","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:52:42","modified":"2014-04-24 14:52:42"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"3196","content_id":"199","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"198","code":"roundtable-atlantic-in-a-changing-world","user_id":"1","title":"Roundtable: Atlantic in a changing world","abstract":"The ATLANTIC FUTURE workshop in Pretoria was organized by GovInn (Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation), University of Pretoria, in June 2014. The workshop took place in the frame of the Governance Innovation Week, a series of seminars, workshops, roundtables and keynote lectures dealing with emerging trends in the field of regional integration, supranational governance, sustainable development, alternative economic thinking and civil society.\r\nAs part of the Workshop, a roundtable on \"The Atlantic in a changing world: emerging economic, social and political relations\", gathering different experts, was held.","body":"<p>The roundtable \"The Atlantic in a changing world: emerging economic, political and social relations\" was chaired by Frank Mattheis (GovInn, University of Pretoria) and was composed of the following experts:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Francis Kornegay (Senior Research Fellow at Institute for Global Dialogue)<\/li>\r\n<li>Sonia Lucarelli (Professor at University of Bologna)<\/li>\r\n<li>R.

One of the topics that drew more attention was the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) currently under negotiation between the EU and the US.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/198-1402656964.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The main ideas that emerged during the roundtable are summarized below.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Francis Kornegay<\/strong> talked of South Africa&rsquo;s role and its pivot position in the Southern sea lanes. In terms of geopolitics in the Atlantic, there exist major issues that need to be sorted out and, for that, there needs to be a North-South dialogue within the Atlantic. We need to look at different organizations, he said, that go beyond the North Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Sonia Lucarelli<\/strong> spoke of how transatlantic relations have been limited to the North-North relations consolidated during the Cold War. We are currently in the process of deconstructing the concept of transatlantic relations limited to the North, so that it includes a wider, broader, space. But this process of deconstruction is still very preliminary and it has important limitations: there are strong differences such as the North-South divide but also great differences within the South; there are differences in the intensity of relations among the regions, such as economic relations (even if South-South trade has increased, the figures cannot be compared), and others such as migration patterns with huge migrations within the regions. In addition, there are also huge asymmetries in the relations between regions.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite these weaknesses and limits, however, there is evidence of change in the Atlantic. The North-North line is strong, in spite of the economic crisis, the South-South is also gaining importance, and strategic relations are particularly important. There is need for more transatlantic cooperation, and enhanced dialogue is desperately needed, as there are common challenges that need to be handled together such as demographic trends or food scarcity.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>R. Andreas Kraemer&nbsp;<\/strong>wondered what will happen within the next years with Russia trying to bring back the Cold War dynamics and how will the Atlantic partnership react to that. He spoke of environmental and resources in the Atlantic. The Atlantic makes sense as a unit of analysis, he said, and although of course it is not a closed space, the Atlantic has its own internal dynamics. Regarding environment, R. Andreas Kraemer explained that the main actors in this arena are disruptive actors (the coal, gas, oil lobbies, etc.) and it does not appear to be a counterweight of pro-environmental actors. This asymmetry, he said, may lead to disaster. In particular, climate change will lead to disastrous consequences. He made another point referring to Brazil, an actor that keeps standing on the side and blocking any initiative. Brazil needs to engage, he affirmed.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Claudia S&aacute;nchez Bajo <\/strong>pointed that we are in a transition from thinking the Atlantic as a divided area, as a space of conquest, to thinking about it as a shared zone. There is an effort to make it a zone peace and free of nuclear weapons, which is a big difference with other oceans. For example, the South Atlantic was declared a &ldquo;Free-Zone&rdquo;, and that opened the way for multiple types of pacific cooperation. There is also a discourse of promoting democracy and human rights. Exchanges of values across the Atlantic have taken place. On another topic, she referred to the emergence of clusters of entrepreneurs from both sides, an interesting development that needs to be looked at.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Antonio Fiori<\/strong> referred to the pivot to Asia. From a Pacific perspective, he said, we need to look also from the other side and need to look at another pivot: the pivot of Asia into the Atlantic. The rise of the Pacific is influencing pan-Atlantic dynamics in a number of ways. Firstly, trade between Atlantic and non-Atlantic partners has boomed. China is one of the main actors here, one of the important trade partners in the Atlantic (it is present in Africa, in Latin America), and there are also other Asian partners such as South Korea or Malaysia. This, he pointed out, resembles traditional colonial patterns. For example, 90% of exports to China are commodities, and 90% of imported goods from China are manufactured goods. It is difficult not to think of becoming locked again in colonial-style relationships. Secondly, trade has also created new port facilities, in particular the Panama Canal, with China controlling the leases at both ends of the Canal. Thirdly, the melting ice in the Arctic is also crucial, as it is opening new routes of communication. It has shifted Atlantic and Pacific attention to the Arctic, and China is there. It is predicted that most of Chinese trade will be carried out through the Northern lines in the future.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Jordi Vaquer <\/strong>started his intervention by pointing that oceans divide and do not unite, except of course if one looks at the Ocean itself (in terms of ecological matters and other areas). He pointed at three other obvious aspects related to relations in the Atlantic. Firstly, there are at least two spaces: the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic; secondly, there are too many asymmetries between the North and the South; and thirdly, the Atlantic is not problematic enough so it does not attract attention, and there is no institutional framework of any meaning compared, for example, to APEC. So, he enquired, why should attention be paid to the Atlantic? In bi-ocean countries such as South Africa or Mexico, there is a choice. Why would Mexico pay attention to Africa, when everything is happening in Asia? However, missing their oceanic potential means missing opportunities. He spoke more specifically of the ATLANTIC FUTURE project, where the Atlantic is looked at as a space, as a point where regions meet, and as a microcosm of what is going on in the world. He carried on by raising the issue of the TTIP. Its signature may reconfigure global and European rules hugely. This could make it impossible for the Atlantic space to break tensions. In conclusion, there is opportunity in the Atlantic, but also real threats. In any case, it is worth exploring it. And by neglecting the Atlantic, we may find that it may become interesting for the wrong reasons, he concluded.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the participants&rsquo; interventions, a debate with the audience ensued around a number of topics and issues. R. Andreas Kraemer was of the opinion that oceans don&rsquo;t divide, as traditionally they have facilitated trade, transfer of ideas, etc. So oceans unite us more that they divide us. Francis Kornegay said that South Africa does not have a geostrategic conception of itself, and that if it did it would try to balance its Indian Ocean with its South Atlantic Ocean potential. On territorial conflicts, Jordi Vaquer pointed out that while the Malvinas issue is a problem in the Atlantic, this does not mean that it has to stop any kind of cooperation, as the Gibraltar conflict between Spain and UK does not, for example. Lorenzo Fioramonti (GovInn, University of Pretoria) enquired whether the Atlantic has a qualitative difference to make, and what it would be. The Atlantic, the participants replied, does make a qualitative difference as it has common understandings of many concepts and we could build on. This is the difference with Asia. Finally, the issue of TTIP was raised again. Valerio Briani (IAI) said that TTIP is probably one of the main things happening in the Atlantic after NATO. R. Andreas Kraemer said that the TTIP is the conflict between rights of corporations and the rights of the people, and the fact that we see it as a geographical thing is a mistake. Jordi Vaquer added that TTIP will have huge negative consequences outside, and it is an affront in Europe. It is an assault of corporate power against democracies, he concluded.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Download the Roundtable Report here:<\/p>","views":"429","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-06-13 10:00:00","modified":"2016-02-05 15:46:16"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"57","content_id":"198","type":"1","file_name":"198-Rountable Report_Economic political and social relations.pdf","description":"","created":"2014-06-13 12:47:45","modified":"2014-06-13 12:47:45"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"3127","content_id":"198","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"3122","content_id":"198","tag_id":"186","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"186","code":"ttip","name":"ttip","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3123","content_id":"198","tag_id":"187","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"187","code":"transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership","name":"transatlantic trade and investment partnership","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3124","content_id":"198","tag_id":"189","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"189","code":"govinn","name":"govinn","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3125","content_id":"198","tag_id":"178","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"178","code":"university-of-pretoria","name":"University of Pretoria","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:52:42","modified":"2014-04-24 14:52:42"}},{"id":"3126","content_id":"198","tag_id":"140","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"3127","content_id":"198","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"197","code":"roundtable-africa-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Roundtable: Africa in the Atlantic","abstract":"The ATLANTIC FUTURE workshop in Pretoria was organized by GovInn (Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation), University of Pretoria, in June 2014. The workshop took place in the frame of the Governance Innovation Week, a series of seminars, workshops, roundtables and keynote lectures dealing with emerging trends in the field of regional integration, supranational governance, sustainable development, alternative economic thinking and civil society.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAs part of the Workshop, a roundtable on \"What role for Africa in a new Atlantic area?\" that gathered a group of experts was held.","body":"<p>The rountable \"What role for Africa in a new Atlantic area?\" was chaired by Dr Msukizi Qobo (GovInn, South Africa) and was composed of the following experts:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Jakkie Cilliers (Executive Director of the Institute for Security Studies)<\/li>\r\n<li>Andrew Grant (Professor at Queen&rsquo;s University, Canada)<\/li>\r\n<li>Catherine Grant (South African Institute of International Affairs)<\/li>\r\n<li>Garth Le Pere (University of Pretoria)<\/li>\r\n<li>Brenan Vickers (Institute for Global Dialogue)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The roundtable participants discussed several issues related to the Atlantic, focusing on Africa. Again, one of the topics that drew more attention was the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) currently under negotiation between the EU and the US, and what implications it would have for Africa.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/197-1402655252.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The main ideas that emerged during the roundtable are summarized below.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Jakkie Cilliers<\/strong> emphasized that there is very limited awareness of the Atlantic in Africa, except for the case of Morocco. South Africa, he pointed out, used to have an interest in the Atlantic but no longer has it. South Africa is interested in Asia, the EU and the US. The only real awareness is on overexploitation of resources largely by European companies. On the TTIP, Cilliers made remarks on the geostrategic implications. TTIP is an effort to maintain Western dominance. It changes economic dynamics and it has energy implications, which has a renewed momentum given the Russia - Ukraine issue. So, countries have two options: either to join this one third of the world, or to opt out. For Africa, because there are such low levels of internal trade, the implications of TTIP would be that may force regional integration in Africa, and also force Africa to look further into Asia and the Pacific, because TTIP will cause loss of trade for Africa. For the future of the Atlantic, discussions need to take hard geostrategic drivers into consideration. Countries in the South Atlantic remain much less important countries in this future world, he said.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Andrew Grant <\/strong>spoke aboutaspects that do not get much attention, such as the Kimberly process on diamonds.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Catherine Grant<\/strong> also referred to the TTIP. She said that the reality of economic linkages of South Africa is that there are strong investment ties with the US and the EU. This is not an ideal picture, she said, but it is South Africa&rsquo;s real picture (with the exception of China). And, she added, there is no particular role of Africa in an emerging Atlantic space, as this is very much dominated by the Northern Atlantic. Africa would not favour Atlantic space over other alliances, because we are still seeing the failure of the US and the EU to carry out any real institutional reform in the economic space. When the space is dominated by these two players, and they are not prepared to recognize the changes in the world, why would Africa be interested in pursuing an Atlantic agenda, she wondered.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Garth Le Pere<\/strong> spoke of the two registers along which Africa can be placed in this emerging Atlantic: the instrumental and the normative one. The instrumental one is capitalist in spirit. The normative one is the US and the EU development cooperation agenda (good governance, institutions, etc.). Both tend to reinforce each other, he said. He also talked about the issue of climate change and pointed that Africa has very low and problematic adaptive responses.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Brendan Vickers<\/strong> said that African countries should engage Atlantic counterparts on African priorities. There are three things he considered to be the African priorities: firstly, structural transformation, as Africa needs to shift from export of commodities to a more sustainable growth; secondly, regional and continental integration; and thirdly, infrastructure development. These, he added, are going to require some kind of closer partnership with Atlantic partnership. He also pointed that it makes no sense to speak of one Atlantic region, as one needs to differentiate between North Atlantic and South Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the participants&rsquo; interventions, a lively debate with the audience ensued around a number of topics and issues, particularly on the TTIP. In this sense, <strong>Lorenzo Fioramonti<\/strong> (GovInn, Univesrity of Pretoria), stated that the TTIP is the most astute way of dodging Doha. Is there an Africa proactive reaction to TTIP or are we just waiting for it to happen, he enquired. In Brendan Vickers&rsquo; view, the focus of US and EU is on TTIP, and it is about raising standards. There is very little Africans can do about TTIP, so Africans should focus on what they have control over, that is the regional and continental integration process. The priority should be infrastructure development, etc. There is a need to focus on the continental FTA. Africa needs to become an actor and not a pawn, he added.<\/p>\r\n<p>On another subject, Jakkie Cilliers referred to the idea of a single integrated Africa as a mirage. He also referred to demographics as something that will have a huge impact in the future. Africa is currently one billion people and will be two billion by 2050. On the other hand, Europe is 500 million now and will remain 500 million by 2050. This is something to reflect about, he concluded.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Download the Rountable Report here:<\/p>","views":"269","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-06-13 09:00:00","modified":"2016-02-03 01:53:50"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"56","content_id":"197","type":"1","file_name":"197-Rountable Report_Africa in the Atlantic.pdf","description":"","created":"2014-06-13 12:28:08","modified":"2014-06-13 12:28:08"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"3238","content_id":"197","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"3232","content_id":"197","tag_id":"140","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"3233","content_id":"197","tag_id":"179","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"179","code":"south-africa","name":"South Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:53:06","modified":"2014-04-24 14:53:06"}},{"id":"3234","content_id":"197","tag_id":"186","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"186","code":"ttip","name":"ttip","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3235","content_id":"197","tag_id":"187","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"187","code":"transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership","name":"transatlantic trade and investment partnership","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3236","content_id":"197","tag_id":"178","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"178","code":"university-of-pretoria","name":"University of Pretoria","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:52:42","modified":"2014-04-24 14:52:42"}},{"id":"3237","content_id":"197","tag_id":"189","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"189","code":"govinn","name":"govinn","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"3238","content_id":"197","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"90","code":"global-challenges-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"GLOBAL CHALLENGES IN THE ATLANTIC","abstract":"","body":"<p><strong>Bonn (Germany), 23-26 June 2014<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>ATLANTIC FUTURE organizes a panel entitled &ldquo;Governing Global Challenges in the Atlantic&rdquo; at the EADI General Conference in Bonn, Germany, which will take place from 23 to 26 June 2014.<\/p>\r\n<p>The 14th General Conference of the<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (<\/strong><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eadi.org\/\">EADI<\/a><\/strong><strong>)<\/strong>&nbsp;is a major European event devoted to the&nbsp;topical theme&nbsp;of &ldquo;Responsible Development in a Polycentric World: Inequality, Citizenship and the Middle Classes&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n<p>Every three years the conference is held in a different European city.

The world is becoming more polycentric and the international system pluralistic, with a variety of norms and ideas upheld and propagated by a multiplicity of players. New actors have emerged and a redistribution of power is taking place at the same time that interdependence is increasing. A general shift of power away from the Northern Atlantic towards the Pacific is a defining feature of contemporary international relations, particularly in terms of economic dynamism. The centre of growth is situated in Asia, with China as a major player. Latin America, with Brazilian leadership, and more recently also Africa are playing a growing role on the international stage. This shift of power towards the Global South is rebalancing relations around and within the Atlantic space. On the other hand, interdependence is increasing, with links growing not only among states but also among non-state actors, and with growing interconnectedness among international actors, issues, technological advances and the diffusion of power.<\/p>\r\n<p>These changes challenge the current status quo and it is necessary to begin rethinking governance issues and how to resolve common problems collectively. The re-distribution of power narrows the scope for global leadership at the same time as interdependence deepens, encompassing not only trade and financial flows but also resource, environmental and security challenges in a web of inter-connected issues.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Atlantic, an interrelated area where flows and linkages are growing, is a space that both mirrors and affects trends on the global stage. Because of its size and diversity, the Atlantic space can be regarded as a laboratory of new material and immaterial linkages, new formats of cooperation and areas of normative dissonance, as well as of new crises, challenges and threats at the interstate and transnational levels. New forms of governance can be designed and tested in order to address common challenges such as a more sustainable development. In spite of the rise of Latin America and West Africa, some countries in these regions face enormous development challenges and are being left out, such as Haiti in the Caribbean, Honduras in Central America or Liberia in Africa, to cite only a few.<\/p>\r\n<p>This panel includes three of the papers produced under the ATLANTIC FUTURE project. The first paper discusses as a key question for the future of multilateralism in the Atlantic whether the narrowing development gap between the North and South Atlantic will be by itself enough to bring about an alignment of worldviews and a convergence of political orientations among the relevant actors &ndash; a question that applies to other regions of the world. Greater symmetry of power and aspirations across the Atlantic basin could prod interested parties to invest into the creation of a (pan) Atlantic order based on the &ldquo;like-mindedness&rdquo; of its participants, starting perhaps with the democratic bond. The other two papers of the panel will mainly focus on two issues that directly affect the responsible development and that need to be addressed collectively: food security and climate change.<\/p>\r\n<p>Food security problems are a hindrance to the development of some countries in the Atlantic. The demand for food is increasing in the Atlantic, at the same time as the costs (seeds, fertilizers and irrigation) are also going up dramatically. Climate change and poor land management are additional factors with catastrophic consequences. A collective solution is required at regional level at least.<\/p>\r\n<p>Climate change impacts such as rising temperatures, changes in seasonal variability and precipitation patterns, coastal inundation, increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events, reductions in freshwater supplies and agricultural yields, and increased health risks threaten Atlantic basin countries and regional development. These impacts will require significant adaptation efforts in order to minimize physical and socioeconomic risks. Successful adaptation to climate change can be facilitated by collective action and by effective governance mechanisms and institutions.<\/p>","views":"90","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":false,"type":"1","created":"2014-04-25 10:44:00","modified":"2016-02-08

More than 50 students attended the seminar. Several senior ATLANTIC FUTURE researchers participated in the seminar: R. Andreas Kraemer at Ecologic Institute (Germany), Alfredo Valladao at HEM (Morocco), Paul Isbell at Johns Hopkins University (United States) and Mark Aspinwall at CIDE (Mexico). Lorena Ruano at CIDE (Mexico) acted as the moderator.","body":"<p>Lorena Ruano (CIDE) presented the ATLANTIC FUTURE project to the students, highlighting its main features. Next, Alfredo Valladao (HEM) spoke about the strengths of the Atlantic. While everybody talks about the Pacific and the emergence of China, he expressed to be sceptical about that. It is the Atlantic century we are going to see coming up, he noted, and not only the North Atlantic but the South Atlantic too. He made the following points: <strong>the new reserves of energy are in the Atlantic, and energy is the core of development and economic life.<\/strong> There is a huge basin of energy that can put us together and make the Atlantic one of the centres of energy producing of the world. Furthermore, North America and South America are the biggest food producers in the world. Africa and Latin America still have a huge stock of free land and water. There are environmental problems, he conceded, but <strong>we can see the Atlantic as a bread basket for the world<\/strong>. That is a huge area where we can have good cooperation. Thirdly, <strong>the Atlantic is home to huge consumer markets<\/strong>. The US alone represents about 1\/3 of the final private consumer, while China only accounts for 4-5% of the world&rsquo;s private consumption. In a world where consumption leads production, the Atlantic will play an enormous role of consumer market for the world&rsquo;s production. Some countries in Africa are developing fast, which will be a huge opportunity for business, cross-interests, production, consumers, etc. But more important, we are living today a real industrial revolution: from the old model of production chains of mass production for mass consumption to new model: that of ICT tech, 3D printing, advanced robotics, etc. That will be very difficult to replicate in some countries in Asia like China, while in the Atlantic there are a lot of possibilities to do that, where societies open enough to be part of this ICT, to be part of it and take advantage of it. Atlantic will probably be the core of the new revolution of the world. Future economic production and consumption will be more centred in the Atlantic.&nbsp; He clarified, though, that this does not mean that it has to be against the Pacific.<\/p>\r\n<p>Paul Isbell (JHU) added that the <strong>Atlantic<\/strong><strong> is a new unit of analysis as well as a tool for new forms of international collaboration<\/strong>. Coming from a view of the Pacific rise, energy dependence to the Middle East, and the rise of the global South, he explained how when drawing an energy map, it revealed that most mental maps that had to do with the Atlantic and energy were either incorrect or beginning to change dramatically. There is a boom in Atlantic energy resources, reserves, in production, shale revolution, the rising role of gas, and other related forms of energy. The Atlantic is almost self-sufficient in energy. <strong>The energy story is really an Atlantic one<\/strong>, he concluded.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mark Aspinwall (CIDE) added how colonisation had a profound effect in linking together Europe, Africa and the Americas. <strong>The Atlantic is a coherent and fundamentally linked area, where there are important flows in terms of values and ideas<\/strong>. The whole idea of international collaboration and international rules is an Atlantic idea and continue to be generated in the Atlantic in an important way. In terms of economics, there has been a huge increase in services, trade and investment in the Atlantic. In terms of security, continued Lorena Ruano (CIDE), NATO is the main military alliance we have today with the most important capacity in terms of military gear and coordination. But one cannot forget that when thinking about the Atlantic, we mostly think of the North Atlantic. The most important economic exchanges happen in the North Atlantic. <strong>The North Atlantic is still dominant but the fastest rising links are in the South Atlantic<\/strong>, especially between Brazil and Africa. The South Atlantic, she concluded, is coming into the picture very fast.<\/p>\r\n<p>In R. Andreas Kraemer&rsquo;s view (Ecologic Institute), the Atlantic story remains strong. Something very important to consider is <strong>the role of China in the Atlantic<\/strong> today. He also made the point that energy systems, all technology providers, all big companies, are Atlantic, which is very disruptive for the environment. But <strong>there is also a problem of solving capacity<\/strong>. In natural resources there is also disruption (with overfishing, destroyed ecosystems, etc.)&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we try to find the best practices, we find them in the North East Atlantic. We can look at them and apply them in other places.<\/p>\r\n<p>Alfredo Valladao (HEM) pointed at one specific problem: there are many challenges. In terms of civil society, things are going quite well: <strong>there is a huge interchange of values, ideas, and people in the Atlantic<\/strong>. And because there is a lot of freedom of travelling and information, the Atlantic is the cradle of cosmopolitan society. In the business sphere, there are a lot of things going on, services and investment, lot of cross investment in countries in the Atlantic. The real challenge is institutionalizing the dialogue, because of bad perceptions. <strong>The Atlantic probably is the space with more regional integration schemes<\/strong>. Brazil is the &ldquo;big guy&rdquo; in the South Atlantic. While it still sees the South Atlantic as its own, it does not have the capabilities to manage it. It is very important to have a real dialogue with Brazil. And Africa is also key. Finally, he referred to the potential for new form of collaboration. Instead of trying to make big schemes, we should concentrate in solving concrete and specific problems together, such as drug trafficking. To sum up, we should look at solvable problems that are Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>An interesting debate with the students ensued. Questions such as the role of Mexico in the Atlantic, what were the effects of being a dual basin country, or the level of institutionalism in the Atlantic were only a few of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Check photos of the Seminar for Young Researchers below:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395739895.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21.920000076293945px;\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395740829.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395740339.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395741703.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395741302.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395742732.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>","views":"266","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"2","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-03-24 14:54:00","modified":"2016-02-01 20:22:23"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"2694","content_id":"54","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"2675","content_id":"54","tag_id":"153","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

seminar organized by the ATLANTIC FUTURE, CIDE in Mexico organised a public event with keynote speaker Jos&eacute; Miguel Insulza, Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the title &ldquo;America in the Atlantic Space&rdquo;. The conference, open to the public and which attracted a large audience, was held at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City on February 21, 2014.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nSeveral issues concerning the role and the future of Latin America in the wider Atlantic space were discussed, with particular attention to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the US and the EU currently under negotiation.","body":"<p>The OAS&nbsp;Secretary General Jos&eacute; Miguel Insulza spoke of the renewal of the Atlantic space and noted that the ATLANTIC FUTURE project is very timely in this context. In recent times, there has been an intellectual and political resurrection of the Atlantic, whose decline was announced prematurely. We are almost used to talk about the Pacific century, he said. Certainly, the rise of Asia is a central phenomenon of our era, but this rise does not occur at the expense of the Atlantic. <strong>The 21st century is not the century of the Pacific but the century of globalization<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Insulza noted, as one of the main issues, the <strong>Transatlantic Agreement negotiations on Trade and Investment (TTIP)<\/strong>, which would unite about 50 % of world output and 20% of foreign direct investment if signed. At the same time, he continued, another agreement for the Pacific (TPP) is under negotiation, with 12 countries representing over 38% of world GDP involved. Insulza placed these negotiations in the context of the<strong> emergence of mega - blocks<\/strong>, and noted that these agreements seek to establish new rules that respond to the realities of the 21st century. It is a context of formation of mega-blocks.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Secretary General highlighted the <strong>global value chains as the second major theme in the Atlantic space<\/strong>. He referred to the geographical fragmentation of production, structured in global value chains, and to the fact that the impact on world trade and investment flows are significant. Today, he stressed, the products we receive are \"made in the world&rdquo;. The centre of the value chain will remain where the development of innovation, scientific development and capital is, said Insulza.<\/p>\r\n<p>Insulza referred to Latin America as one of the economic successes of the last decade, but that now faces the risk of not being able to maintain the achievements. They have the challenge of integration into the world economy and its relationship with the mega - blocks as well as the challenge of a more equitable and sustainable growth.<\/p>\r\n<p>He added that export diversification is very important for the Atlantic space in the immediate future. A <strong>greater trade integration of production is needed<\/strong> to reap the benefits of integration. Intraregional trade in Latin America is dominated by trade in final goods. So the challenge may represent a potential transatlantic relations throughout the region. The relationship between the European Union and Latin America has evolved tremendously over the last 30 years. In 2010 Mercosur generated almost half of exports to the European Union. Mexico and Cariforum have a much greater participation in imports from the European Union. There is great potential for growth.<\/p>\r\n<p>Insulza described the fact that most attention goes to Atlantic space because of the start of the negotiations for the TTIP as a great paradox, as this is limited to the more traditional members of the Atlantic Alliance. He warned not to mix the bilateral trade agreement with the creation of a true Atlantic space. <strong>The TTIP is limited to the North Atlantic, but the dialogue should include the rest<\/strong>. Insulza also referred to the importance of South -South relationship. The Secretary- General went on to say that there is a <strong>risk of excluding the South from the dialogue on the Atlantic space<\/strong>. It is time to \"<em>join our voices for a renewed Atlantic space with some cooperation mechanism Atlantic space<\/em>\". In such a framework and voluntarily, Atlantic countries could cooperate on many issues, not only commercial but also environmental and many others.<\/p>\r\n<p>The <strong>emergence of mega - blocks and globalization pose serious challenges<\/strong> for the region. America is the only continent that is Atlantic and Pacific at a time. It could happen that participation in both is possible, or that the label Pacific country or Atlantic country is seen as a new division block.<\/p>\r\n<p>After Jos&eacute; Miguel Isulza speech, a round of questions was opened to the public. Issues such as the negotiation of TTIP, the risks of Mexico looking more towards the Pacific, the key issues for Latin America, or the alleged competition between TPP and TTIP, among others, were addressed.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Download the full conference report here:<\/p>","views":"228","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-02-27 09:00:00","modified":"2016-02-01 20:13:12"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"54","content_id":"196","type":"1","file_name":"196-Conference Report_America in the Atlantic_Mexico.pdf","description":"","created":"2014-06-13 11:40:17","modified":"2014-06-13 11:40:17"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"3176","content_id":"196","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"3170","content_id":"196","tag_id":"170","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"170","code":"mexico","name":"Mexico","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-01-15 11:11:11","modified":"2014-01-15 11:11:11"}},{"id":"3171","content_id":"196","tag_id":"143","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"143","code":"america","name":"America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:41:45","modified":"2013-10-25 10:41:45"}},{"id":"3172","content_id":"196","tag_id":"141","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"141","code":"latin-america","name":"Latin America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:43","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:43"}},{"id":"3173","content_id":"196","tag_id":"153","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

These are just a few of the questions that will be addressed by the host partner CIDE (Mexico), Aberystwyth University (UK), HEM (Morocco) and Johns Hopkins University (USA).<\/p>\r\n<p>This event is <strong>by invitation only<\/strong>.<\/p>","views":"242","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":false,"type":"1","created":"2014-01-15 17:54:00","modified":"2016-01-26 04:12:52"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":"40","datetime":"2014-02-20 10:00:00","country":"Mexico","city":"Mexico DF","address":"","map":""},"Resource":[{"id":"42","content_id":"40","type":"1","file_name":"40-Workshop on Economy and Finance in the Atlantic.pdf","description":"Workshop on Economy and Finance in the Atlantic","created":"2014-01-30 11:53:28","modified":"2014-01-30 11:53:28"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"2527","content_id":"40","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"2517","content_id":"40","tag_id":"20","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"2518","content_id":"40","tag_id":"16","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"2519","content_id":"40","tag_id":"78","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"78","code":"transport","name":"Transport","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:52:35","modified":"2013-09-27 10:52:35"}},{"id":"2520","content_id":"40","tag_id":"36","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"36","code":"events","name":"Events","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"995B31","created":"2013-09-27 09:58:37","modified":"2013-09-27 09:58:37"}},{"id":"2521","content_id":"40","tag_id":"153","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

project, the German Marshall Fund organized a working lunch in the framework of the Emerging Leaders Program at The Atlantic Dialogues on Friday, October 25, 2013. During the working lunch, the emerging leaders were given an opportunity to discuss some of the key themes of the ATLANTIC FUTURE, from security to energy, global governance to regionalism, and migration to trade, with senior researchers.","body":"<p>The table-top discussions were chaired by representatives of the ATLANTIC FUTURE and gathered around ten emerging leaders each. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.atlanticdialogues.org\/about-the-atlantic-dialogues\/young-leaders\/atlantic-dialogues-emerging-leaders-agenda-2013\/\"><strong><em>2013 Atlantic Dialogues Emerging Leaders Program<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/a>brought together forty-eight rising leaders from around the Atlantic Basin and focused on the exchange of ideas, peer to peer learning, and skills to effect change. The ATLANTIC FUTURE working session served as the topical introduction to <em>The Atlantic Dialogues<\/em> conference which the young leaders attended as well and where some of the scholars engaged in the ATLANTIC FUTURE project had an active role. Launched in 2012,<em>&nbsp;The Atlantic Dialogues<\/em>&nbsp;is emerging as a leading annual forum for decision makers to discuss global issues and partnerships, with an emphasis on the Southern Atlantic and transatlantic relations beyond traditional north-north lines. This high-level gathering is a unique opportunity for leaders from the four continents of the Atlantic to debate the changing dynamics across the wider basin and help shape the broader transatlantic agenda.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ATLANTIC FUTURE working lunch started with opening remarks by Corinna H&ouml;rst, Deputy Director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States&rsquo; Brussels office, in which she presented the ATLANTIC FUTURE project in a global context and introduced the goals and deliverables. The following group discussions focused on multilateralism (WP1), economic trends (WP2), security issues (WP3), norms in the Atlantic (WP4\/5), and regionalism (WP8).<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>The Atlantic world and the Future of Multilateralism<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Atlantic world and the Future of Multilateralism&rdquo; discussion was chaired by Emiliano Alessandri, Senior Transatlantic Fellow, German Marshall Fund of the United States. In light of changing dynamics in global and regional multilateral organizations, the discussion focused on whether ongoing power shifts will lead to more or less multilateralism in the Atlantic. Other axis of reflection included the impact of growing economic interdependence on international cooperation around the Atlantic Basin and what Atlantic dynamics can tell us about larger developments at the global level.<\/p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li><strong>Overcoming the North-South Divide: Economic Re-balancing in the Atlantic<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>This discussion was chaired by Chris Hoornaert, Ambassador of the Port Authority of Antwerp, Port Authority of Antwerp and focused on trends in trade and investment in the Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>The South Atlantic space has in the last decade won greater economic and political autonomy from the United States and Europe. Trade and investment have been growing fast in the South-South Atlantic relationship, and the regions of the South are also witnessing a reconfiguration in political influence. China has become a major partner of African as well as Latin American economies. The rift between the West and the Global South still defines to a large extent the rules for interaction but new relationships are also emerging that defy the North-South divide. In this context, the discussion also addressed the question of the extent to which, asthe South Atlantic space gains greater economic weight, re-balancing will lead to greater cooperation or competition in the region.<\/p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong>Atlantic Security: Towards a Pan-Atlantic approach?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>Nicoletta Pirozzi, Senior Fellow, Istituto Affari Internazionali chaired the discussion &ldquo;Atlantic Security: Towards a Pan-Atlantic approach?&rdquo; The Atlantic North and South have witnessed much lower levels of inter-state conflict than other areas of the world, and the South Atlantic is one of the few regions of the world that is free of weapons of mass destruction. Nonetheless, as some states grow stronger than others and competition for resources increases, military build-ups or other forms of traditional threats should not be discarded. In this context the discussion centered on the likelihood for new comprehensive Atlantic cooperation frameworks and the areas of security policy in which greater progress could be made.<\/p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li><strong>Moving in the Same Direction? Norms in the Atlantic.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Moving in the Same Direction? Norms in the Atlantic&rdquo; was chaired by Camilla Adelle, Research Fellow at the University of Pretoria. This session addressed the role of transnational networks of state and non-state actors in the soft transfer of ideas, norms and principles in building an Atlantic region. Areas covered include: whether the pan-Atlantic region is becoming a &ldquo;community&rdquo; in which key ideas, norms, and principles are bound to converge; which are the most relevant processes through which ideas, norms, and principles are transferred, contested, and re-conceptualized; whether the North-South rebalancing overall is leading to greater alignment or discrepancy between value systems; and what sub-regions or countries can play a leading role moving the debate on norms forward at the Atlantic level?<\/p>\r\n<p>5.<strong> Shifting Regionalism<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>R. Andreas Kraemer, Founding Director and CEO, Ecologic Institute,Berlin, chaired the discussion on &ldquo;Shifting Regionalism.&rdquo; This conversation focused on whether and how the emergence of powerful regional actors having an impact on regional integration processes and affecting inter-regional cooperation across the Atlantic Basin. The emerging leaders also discussed the direction of regional integration, whether actors around the Atlantic Basin are moving toward greater simplification of regional cooperation efforts or greater diversity and plurality of initiatives.<\/p>\r\n<p>The participants were very enthusiastic about the opportunity to engage with the senior scholars and learn about different perspectives to the Atlantic space and engaged in lively discussions on topics relevant to the Atlantic Future project. Indeed, the sessions provided this diverse group of Emerging Leaders with new perspectives on transatlantic relations, as a whole, and their respective topics more specifically. The emerging leaders were better able to identify and conceptualize the wider Atlantic space through the working lunch discussions. By addressing issues from security to trade through the lens of the Atlantic Basin, the ATLANTIC FUTURE working lunch prepared the Emerging Leaders to take full advantage of the exchanges during the <em>Atlantic Dialogues<\/em>, imprinting on them a lasting understanding of this &ldquo;new&rdquo; geopolitical space. The working lunch also provided researchers of the ATLANTIC FUTURE project with an opportunity to discuss their findings with a critical audience, and gain input on their research from Emerging Leaders from Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, and Europe.<\/p>\r\n<p>A PDF presentation of the Working Lunch is attached.<\/p>\r\n<p>Check photos of the Working Lunch below:<\/p>\r\n<p

in Rabat, Morocco, where a panel of experts shared their interesting views on the topic with an audience of 200 people. The event took place on 25 October 2013 at Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale du Royaume du Maroc (Morocco National Library), after a 2-day seminar as part of the first plenary meeting of the ATLANTIC FUTURE.","body":"<p>The conference was chaired by Driss Ksikes (Director of CESEM, HEM) and counted with a panel of five speakers: Abderrahmane Hadj Nacer, economist and former governor of the Central Bank of Algeria, Bichara Khader, Professor at UCL, Belgium, Karim El Aynaoui, Senior Researcher at OCP Policy Center, Alfredo Valladao, Senior Researcher at HEM and Jordi Vaquer, Senior Associate of CIDOB and Scientific Coordinator of ATLANTIC FUTURE.<\/p>\r\n<p>The speakers covered a wide range of topics related to the Arab world and the Atlantic space. The chair <strong>Driss Ksikes<\/strong> opened the conference by giving an overview of the project Atlantic Future and by pointing at the Atlantic potential for growth. He referred to Morocco as a country that materializes the link between the Arab world and the Atlantic space. <strong>Bichara Khader<\/strong> spoke of the extreme verticality of the relationship between Europe and the Maghreb and of the need for Arab countries to reach Africa and Latin America. The exchanges between Brazil and the Arab world have increased a lot in the recent times. He also referred to the role of new international actors such as China or the United States in the years to come<strong>.<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Abderrahmane<\/strong> <strong>Hadj Nasser <\/strong>spoke of the relevance of monetary control. Money is trust. He referred to the Quincy Agreement in 1945 between U.S. president Roosevelt and the King of Saudi Arabia. In his view, the agreement represented that trust is no longer based on a particular resource but on the authoritarian control of resources.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Jordi Vaquer<\/strong> said that there is a tendency to forget Africa in the Atlantic history. He viewed the Atlantic no only as an area of opportunities but also of threats to certain countries, due to issues such as piracy or the drug trafficking routes. He also referred to fragile countries and also to other countries that are well governed but that despite this they are still vulnerable, such as the case of Cape Verde. On the cultural field, he insisted on the great amount of links that exist within the Atlantic space. A great part of the music in the world, for example, is of Atlantic origin. Referring to social links, he spoke of the change that has taken place, as flows are not one-way anymore. For example, there are more Portuguese citizens in Angola now than there were in the colonial times, and Morocco can also be an opportunity for Spanish citizens. He also referred to social movements in Tunisia or Morocco, which inspired the 15-M in Spain, the Somos 37 in Chile, etc. He also referred to food security as an important issue in the Atlantic. While the Atlantic contains the biggest amounts of water reserves, there are areas (such as Subsaharan Africa) that suffer food security issues.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Alfredo Valladao<\/strong> focused on the relationship between the Gulf countries and the BRICs, and referred to the shift towards the Atlantic in the oil production. The geopolitical implications of such shift are enormous, he said, as Gulf countries face a loss of negotiation and strategic power. He also spoke of the strong dependency of BRICs towards China and India. On China, he referred to potential internal problems that could affect its growth.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Karim El Aynaoui<\/strong> pointed out that Brazil and China growth is slowing down. He also criticized Europe for not being aware of the developments in the South. The flow of production factors, he said, is an important question. He concluded that here are many questions that need to be posed in order to understand the current shifts.<\/p>\r\n<p>An interesting debate and exchange of ideas ensured among the speakers on different topics and issues.<strong> Driss Ksikes<\/strong> added that there is a perception that the Atlantic is a pacific area and that it is a community of values. He wondered whether there is a clash between the values of the Arab \/ Islam world and the values of the Atlantic world. Also, he questioned the implications of the loss of strategic power of the Gulf countries. He finally referred to the potential of innovation and mobility within the Atlantic space. On a different topic, <strong>Abderrahmane<\/strong> <strong>Hadj Nasser<\/strong> referred to wahabism, and pointed that flows and linkages mean to be conditioned to the rest of the world, and therefore it is important to integrate wahabism. <strong>Bichara Khader<\/strong> regretted the fact that the Arab world is closed due to internal problems in a time when the world is being redesigned. <strong>Karim El Aynaoui<\/strong> added that Morocco has to define its place in the Atlantic. <strong>Alfredo Valladao<\/strong> also spoke of the fundamental role of the Atlantic space as an area of connections, exchange of ideas, capacity to intermix, and great capabilities for dialogue. <strong>Jordi Vaquer<\/strong> concluded that the Atlantic space will be built through a tissue of links rather than through a big institution, and through bilateral relations rather than based on a comprehensive agreement.<\/p>\r\n<p>The floor was opened to the public and a very lively debate ensued with the audience, with issues such as the relationship between development and peace, climate change, food security, piracy or energy poverty, among others.<\/p>\r\n<p>The conference was conducted in French and translation services into English were available.<\/p>\r\n<p>A Pdf version of the report is attached.<\/p>\r\n<p>Below you can see some photos of the event.<\/p>\r\n<p

Within the Atlantic space, there are growing links in the fields of energy, commerce, human security, norms, values and other issues related to the ocean itself. As interdependency relations grow through this basin, new opportunities emerge, but also new vulnerabilities affect its interlinking societies. With more and more urgent common problems, Atlantic states and regions are seeking with renewed interest their counterparts in all shores of the ocean. Authors from different shores of the Atlantic, some of them partners of ATLANTIC FUTURE or members of our Scientific and Advisory Panel, analyse from a wide range of theoretical and empirical orientations the consequences of the current changes and transformations within the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p>Check the contents <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cidob.org\/en\/publications\/publication_series\/revista_cidob_d_afers_internacionals\/rediscovering_the_atlantic_space\" target=\"_blank\">here.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cidob.org\/en\/publications\/articulos\/revista_cidob_d_afers_internacionals\/102_103\/introduction_a_new_perspective_on_the_atlantic\">Introduction: a new perspective on the Atlantic<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Anna Ayuso and Elina Viilup<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cidob.org\/en\/publications\/articulos\/revista_cidob_d_afers_internacionals\/102_103\/atlantic_communities_asymmetries_and_convergences\">Atlantic communities: asymmetries and convergences<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Dorval Brunelle<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cidob.org\/en\/publications\/articulos\/revista_cidob_d_afers_internacionals\/102_103\/towards_a_governance_agenda_for_the_emerging_atlantic_hemisphere\">Towards a governance agenda for the emerging Atlantic Hemisphere<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Daniel S.

Trade and investment have been growing fast in the South-South Atlantic relationship, and the regions of the South are also witnessing a reconfiguration in political influence.","body":"<p>The South Atlantic space has in the last decade won greater economic and political autonomy from the US and Europe. The dynamic Asian markets have driven the economic growth of major South American countries (such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile or Peru), most notably in the sector of commodities, both non-renewable (such as mineral and fossil fuels) and renewable (such as agricultural products). Asian, mainly Chinese, products have been flooding markets across the region. An even more dramatic shift has taken place in Africa, where the search for commodities has attracted unprecedented levels of Chinese investment, and has fuelled economic growth and further investment from other non-traditional sources such as the Gulf States, India, Malaysia or Brazil.<\/p>\r\n<p>Trade and investment in the South-South Atlantic have been growing fast, both within the Atlantic space and between the Atlantic and extra-Atlantic partners. Trade between Brazil and Africa has increased six fold between 2000 and 2011 (from US$4.2 billion to US$27.6 billion), and Brazil is the third largest trade partner of Africa as a whole, after China and India. Oil-producing Nigeria and Angola account for almost 50% of these trade flows. At the same time, China-Africa trade, driven by commodities, has grown more than ten-fold over the last decade, doubling in nominal terms every three years. The share of Brazil&rsquo;s trade with the other BRICs jumped from 9% to 17% in the space of only three years, from 2006 to 2009. The old, largely rhetoric South-South cooperation has evolved into a complex relationship which involves a growing number of actors with different objectives; among them are transnational corporations and powerful lobbies but also cities, language communities or diasporas.<\/p>\r\n<p>The regions of the South are also witnessing a reconfiguration in political influence. North Atlantic powers are losing ground, thus allowing non-Atlantic actors to seek new influence and regional actors to emerge. In Sub-Saharan Africa, political investment by South Africa and other regional players in the African Union and sub-regional organizations is paralleled by a creeping &lsquo;multipolarisation&rsquo; of continental politics. In particular, South Africa and Nigeria aim to consolidate their role as regional leaders and important interlocutors for third partners beyond Africa. Together with Brazil and India, South Africa has launched the IBSA format for political dialogue and economic cooperation, has invested in the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) platform on climate change negotiations and joined the BRICS in 2011. At the same time, it has developed a strategic partnership with the EU, with the latter seeking to strike a new balance between bilateral and inter-regional engagement both in Africa and in South America. Nigeria is seeking political benefits from its pivotal role in energy flows, accounting for 11% of US oil imports, 16% of South Africa&rsquo;s and 8% of India&rsquo;s.<\/p>\r\n<p>North Africa, long time stagnant at the political and economic level, is at the heart of changes that are shaking the Arab world and transforming its political and social landscape. The problems that still trouble the region &ndash; youth unemployment, gender inequality, lack of competitiveness and dismal research and innovation rates &ndash; could be overcome faster than expected if the current transformation liberates new creative energies in all fields, from economy to social structures. North Africa is moving beyond its dependency on Europe and slowly globalizing its international partners, searching for new opportunities in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Gulf.<\/p>\r\n<p>In South America, Brazil&rsquo;s external projection is manifest in its solid regional engagement and good cooperation with its neighbours. Brazil, as a leading investor in South America, has sought to deliver new impulse to MERCOSUR (Common Southern Market) and is providing political impetus to regional cooperation through new formats such as UNASUR (Union of South American Nations) and the CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States). Also thanks to such initiatives, cooperation and integration processes have acquired new dynamism in South America. A shift has been taking place from mainly liberalisation-based economic integration towards a more physical and political agenda that includes asymmetries, complementarities and dispute resolution forums. Against this backdrop, the US and the EU have reached out to Brazil to establish and develop bilateral strategic partnerships.<\/p>","views":"523","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"2","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-07-24 18:26:00","modified":"2016-02-05

Because of its size and diversity, the Atlantic space can be regarded as a laboratory of new material and immaterial linkages, new formats of cooperation and areas of normative dissonance, as well as of new crises, challenges and threats at the interstate and transnational levels. The rift between the &lsquo;West&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Global South&rsquo; cuts across the Atlantic space and still defines, to a large extent, the rules for interaction. The wider Atlantic space both mirrors and affects trends on the global stage. Within the &lsquo;Atlantic Lab&rsquo; new flows follow new patterns, emerging powers pursue multiple options while established ones adjust their approaches, and new identities are in the making.<\/p>","views":"113","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-07-19 10:11:00","modified":"2016-01-25 05:04:52"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"1454","content_id":"1","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"1447","content_id":"1","tag_id":"6","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"6","code":"globalisation","name":"Globalisation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:03:52","modified":"2013-09-27 10:03:52"}},{"id":"1448","content_id":"1","tag_id":"5","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"5","code":"atlantic-space","name":"Atlantic space","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:55:08","modified":"2013-09-27 09:55:08"}},{"id":"1449","content_id":"1","tag_id":"1","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"1","code":"atlantic-basin","name":"Atlantic Basin","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:54:32","modified":"2013-09-27 09:54:32"}},{"id":"1450","content_id":"1","tag_id":"3","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"3","code":"west","name":"West","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:21","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:21"}},{"id":"1451","content_id":"1","tag_id":"4","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"4","code":"global-south","name":"Global South","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:58:55","modified":"2013-09-27 09:58:55"}},{"id":"1452","content_id":"1","tag_id":"144","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"144","code":"threats","name":"Threats","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:45:23","modified":"2013-10-25 10:45:23"}},{"id":"1453","content_id":"1","tag_id":"88","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"88","code":"governance","name":"Governance","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:55:35","modified":"2013-09-27 10:55:35"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"1454","content_id":"1","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"2","code":"the-exploration-of-the-new-atlantic-space","user_id":"1","title":"The exploration of the new Atlantic space","abstract":"Why is the exploration of the new Atlantic space relevant and important?","body":"<p>Globalisation is uneven, in the sense that it affects certain countries and actors more than others; it forges interdependencies that are thicker or thinner than others.

A global order in evolution contextualises the research of ATLANTIC FUTURE.","body":"<p>The international order, as established at the end of World War II, has changed beyond recognition over the last two decades. The triumph of the North Atlantic powers in the Cold War slowly started to give way to <strong>a redistribution of power in all its dimensions<\/strong> (hard and soft, political and economic), which currently is the predominant trend reshaping the international system. It includes both <strong>power shifts among state actors, most notably towards Asia, and the diffusion of power away from states to a variety of non-state actors.<\/strong> However, that power transition does not seem to lead to a succession of US pre-eminence. On the one hand, the material resources of the US remain unparalleled across most dimensions of power, although the economic crisis is seriously affecting the country&rsquo;s profile on the international stage. On the other hand, no individual country, or group of countries, seems able to replace the US in its traditional role of milieu-shaping and provision of global public goods for the foreseeable future. Reforming multilateral frameworks, therefore, is going to be critical to ensure openness and stability of a polycentric international system. Creation of new formats such as the G20 and a progressive transformation of existing institutions, such as the IMF, are part of the adjustment to the new realities. A more open multilateralism is emerging with the diversification of the multilateral playing fields and the emergence of new actors in multilateralism other than states.<\/p>\r\n<p>A general shift of power away from the Northern Atlantic towards the Pacific, or even the Asian heartland, is a defining feature of contemporary international relations, particularly in terms of economic dynamism. The centre of growth is situated in Asia, with China as a major player. Latin America, with Brazilian leadership, and more recently also Africa are playing a growing role on the international stage.<strong> This shift of power towards the Global South is rebalancing relations around and within the Atlantic space<\/strong>. Until recently the North America-Europe transatlantic link was overwhelmingly predominant in the region. North-South relations between the USA and Latin America and Europe and Africa have suffered from a profound asymmetry. However, slowly the space is opening up and multiple levels of engagement are developing across the Atlantic space and with partners in other regions. Regional formats and bilateral partnerships are redrawing the political map of the Atlantic, including a proliferation of South-South links as well as triangulations between advanced, middle income and developing partners (e.g. the trilateral alliance between Brazil, South Africa and India or the BRICS). Large emerging powers such as Brazil reach out to Africa and aim to play a bigger role on global issues in multilateral and mini-lateral fora.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"158","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"1","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-05-02 10:45:00","modified":"2016-02-08

perhaps the predominant trend reshaping the international system. Different authors have offered different readings and conceptualisations of the erosion of American and Western predominance coining concepts such as multipolar world, a post-American world or a non-polar world. ATLANTIC FUTURE adopts a distinct position.","body":"<p>ATLANTIC FUTURE adopts the concept of interpolarity, coined by the researcher Giovanni Grevi. It is ATLANTIC FUTURE&rsquo;s assumption that we live in an interpolar world, where multipolarity and interdependence are equally important. On the one hand, by rescuing polarity we are able to defend the central role of the state, which allows, among other things, to account for the rise of China, Brazil and other emerging state powers. On the other hand, interdependence captures the links not only among states but also among non-state actors, and stresses the increasing interconnectedness among international actors and issues and technological advance and the diffusion of power.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Atlantic, the space where American and, before that, European pre-eminence was most evident in the past, is changing fast, and its study can yield useful insights into how interpolarity works in practice. When looking at relations between large and middle powers, sheer balance of power paradigms fit international politics in the Atlantic space less than the more nuanced concept of interpolarity. The latter does not exclude or neglect competition or hard geopolitical considerations, but sets them in the broader framework of interdependence. This is all the more relevant in a context such as the Atlantic where relations between the main state actors are predominantly not defined in antagonistic terms and trans-national threats are largely common ones. An interpolar system is interest-based, problem driven and process-oriented. Focusing on interests does not mean emphasising ruthless self-interest only but also exploring the scope for the convergence of national interests, and relevant incentives. Numerous challenges across the Atlantic require cooperative solutions and awareness of such imperative across different regions, while arguably growing, needs scrutiny. For example, organised crime or climate change affect different countries in different ways.<\/p>","views":"274","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"2","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-05-01 16:24:00","modified":"2016-02-05 22:12:22"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"1439","content_id":"3","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"1428","content_id":"3","tag_id":"123","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"123","code":"international-balance-of-power","name":"International balance of power","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 09:50:08","modified":"2013-09-30 09:50:08"}},{"id":"1429","content_id":"3","tag_id":"121","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"121","code":"interdependence","name":"Interdependence","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 13:12:07","modified":"2013-09-27 13:12:07"}},{"id":"1430","content_id":"3","tag_id":"11","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"11","code":"multipolarity","name":"Multipolarity","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:04:11","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:11"}},{"id":"1431","content_id":"3","tag_id":"42","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"42","code":"brics","name":"BRICS","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:56:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:56:17"}},{"id":"1432","content_id":"3","tag_id":"5","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"5","code":"atlantic-space","name":"Atlantic space","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:55:08","modified":"2013-09-27 09:55:08"}},{"id":"1433","content_id":"3","tag_id":"138","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"138","code":"europe","name":"Europe","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:16:35","modified":"2013-10-25 10:16:35"}},{"id":"1434","content_id":"3","tag_id":"7","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"7","code":"power","name":"Power","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:05:06","modified":"2013-09-27 10:05:06"}},{"id":"1435","content_id":"3","tag_id":"41","order":"8","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"41","code":"actors","name":"Actors","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:53:51","modified":"2013-09-27 09:53:51"}},{"id":"1436","content_id":"3","tag_id":"143","order":"9","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"143","code":"america","name":"America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:41:45","modified":"2013-10-25 10:41:45"}},{"id":"1437","content_id":"3","tag_id":"3","order":"10","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"3","code":"west","name":"West","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:21","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:21"}},{"id":"1438","content_id":"3","tag_id":"147","order":"11","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"147","code":"international-relations","name":"international relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-11-18 11:32:59","modified":"2013-11-18 11:32:59"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"1439","content_id":"3","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"5","code":"the-thematic-areas-of-atlantic-future","user_id":"1","title":"The thematic areas of ATLANTIC FUTURE","abstract":"Four main areas have been identified as the main potential drivers for cooperation in the Atlantic. ATLANTIC FUTURE will obtain information and a mental map of the trends in these issue areas.\r\n&nbsp;","body":"<p>ATLANTIC FUTURE work focuses on four thematic areas: economy and finance, security, political, social and cultural relations, and resources and environment.<\/p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Economy and Finance<\/em><\/h3>\r\n<p>Economic links are at the forefront of the transformation of the Atlantic world. Changes in global finances are markedly reflected in the region. Global and regional economic growth is at the same time the result of and the stimulus for a large increase in trade flows and their diversification. Financial flows across the region take very different shapes: transfers resulting from trade imbalances, credit and financial investment, FDI, development aid and migrant remittances, to name only the most significant. Each of them is undergoing substantial change across the Atlantic. Tourism is also playing a growing role in linking regions together. All those flows are the background for the emergence of new routes of transportation, both over the sea and by air, and even of pan-Atlantic infrastructure, such as undersea internet cable connections.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Security<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Compared to the Pacific or the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic does not appear as a source of global insecurities or tensions. The relations between most powers in the area are relatively cordial and where there is open antagonism, for example between Cuba and the United States, or open territorial grievances, like between Great Britain and Argentina over the Malvinas\/Falklands or between Spain and Morocco over the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, an open military conflict seems a remote possibility. However, under that quiet surface, a military build-up in Latin America serves as a reminder that not all conventional threats can be safely discarded in the Atlantic. This holds even truer for non-conventional threats. The lethal combination between fragile states, lucrative narcotics smuggling routes and vast sea and land borders that are difficult to control, links the countries on both sides of the Central Atlantic in a vicious circle of violence, poverty, instability and all forms of organised crime. As traffic grows along the Atlantic sea lanes, maritime security becomes a regional and a global concern, in particular in view of the increase in piracy activities in the Gulf of Guinea or drug trafficking across the Atlantic sores.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>People and Institutions<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Large and mid-sized players, notably emerging ones in South America and Africa, pursue a multi-vector foreign policy that result in new diplomatic and political ties. Brazil and South Africa, closely followed by other middle regional players such as Argentina, Colombia or Nigeria, feature multiple identities as developing and middle-income countries, champions of the South, protagonists of the global economy, leaders of regional cooperation and pioneers of new partnerships across the Atlantic as well as with other regions of the world. The North Atlantic actors cannot assume that predominance of democratic governance in Africa and South America will necessarily result in convergence of values and perceptions, and even less in automatic alliances on global issues. Contrasting perspectives on such crucial issues as human rights or democratisation can become significant obstacles to a wider Atlantic cooperation. The proliferation of actors and agendas challenges the traditional approach of the US and the EU towards their Southern neighbours in the Atlantic space but also bears the seeds of new opportunities for cooperation and mutual benefit. A number of variables, both internal and external to the Atlantic space, will determine whether these seeds will bear fruit.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Resources and Environment<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Energy and climate issues, in particular, have become key Atlantic vectors, as an incipient &ldquo;Atlantic Basin energy system&rdquo; (re)emerges as an important subsystem within the global political and energy economy, alongside the Pacific and Indian Ocean Basin-systems. The energy map of the Atlantic area is one that reflects not only the very different real income and consumption levels of the Atlantic continents, but also the divergent energy economies and distinct energy policy environments and evolutions. Key global trends (including climate change, intensifying competition for resources, the imperative to eliminate poverty) are pushing in the direction of energy policy and regulatory convergence within the Atlantic Basin and toward a deepening of transatlantic energy trade and investment. The Southern Cone and Southern Africa have recently emerged as new centers of gravity within the energy landscape of the Atlantic Basin. Many new energy trends are now emerging in the Southern Atlantic, although the unconventional gas revolution in the United States is shifting energy trade patterns, and the search for renewables on each Atlantic continent also offers considerable potential for transformation. The Atlantic Basin accounts for approximately one-third of both global oil and gas production. Over 40% of world petroleum reserves and nearly 12% of global conventional gas reserves are located in the Atlantic world. These figures are also likely to increase in coming years, as more unconventional oil sources - offshore oil, Arctic oil, and shale gas - are discovered, then classified as proven reserves, and eventually brought online as new production. The Southern Atlantic alone could account for as much as 20% of global energy demand by 2035, with the entire Atlantic Basin contributing nearly half. The expected boom in Southern Atlantic energy demand lends the Atlantic Basin energy space more critical mass within the global energy system.<\/p>","views":"393","shares":"1","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-04-19 18:29:00","modified":"2016-02-06

(CIDE) and<em>&nbsp;Outlook for the Fossil Fuel and Renewable Energy Industries in the Wider Atlantic Space <\/em>by&nbsp;Christoph H. Stefes and R. Andreas Kraemer Ecologic Institute Berlin<\/p>","body":"<p><em>Economic and financial links <\/em>are strong across the Atlantic space, especially the North Atlantic. While North-South and South-South links are growing, they are influenced by the presence of external factors, like China or the price of commodities. There is strong evidence of continued and lasting economic interaction among the developed Atlantic in the north, and there does appear to be some trend toward the integration of Africa and Latin America into the Atlantic (and global) trade and investment regimes, through their northern partners, partly because of the rise of emerging market economies (especially Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa) and partly because of decisions to increase South-South economic interactions.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Fossil Fuel and Renewable Energy Industries<\/em> explains that although, the Atlantic Space holds a large share of the world&rsquo;s unexploited fossil fuel reserves, including 40% of oil reserves, 20% of natural gas reserves, and roughly 40% of coal reserves (BP 2015), the future of the industry is uncertain. Large profit margins (in the past) and continued subsides have made some of these unconventional and difficult hydrocarbon reserves easier to access via new technologies, particularly in the cases of the North Atlantic shale revolution and the Southern Atlantic &ldquo;oil ring&rdquo; ( Isbell 2014). In the North Atlantic, shale gas now accounts for more than 35% of American gas production, compared to 2% in 2000. Demand for shale oil and gas is predicted to rise from 1.96 BCM\/day to 2.69 BCM\/day by 2035 (Szalai 2013). In the Southern Atlantic oil ring, deep-water offshore oil rigs now span from Namibia and Morocco in the east to Argentina and the Gulf of Mexico (Isbell 2014), but their further expansion is in doubt given current and projected oil prices.<\/p>","views":"378","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-12-03 12:16:00","modified":"2016-02-08 11:52:48"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"182","content_id":"1599","type":"1","file_name":"1599-Economic and financial links in the Atlantic Space.pdf","description":"Economic and financial links in the Atlantic Space","created":"2015-12-03 12:42:22","modified":"2015-12-03 12:42:22"},{"id":"183","content_id":"1599","type":"1","file_name":"1599-Outlook for the fossil fuel and renewable energy industries in the wider Atlantic Space.pdf","description":"Outlook for the Fossil fuel and renewable energy industries in the Wider Atlantic Sapce","created":"2015-12-03 12:49:05","modified":"2015-12-03 12:49:05"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"7346","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"7338","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"20","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"7339","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"139","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"139","code":"asia","name":"Asia","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:25","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:25"}},{"id":"7340","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"140","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"7341","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"141","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"141","code":"latin-america","name":"Latin America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:43","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:43"}},{"id":"7342","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"206","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"206","code":"economic-integration","name":"economic integration","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7343","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"26","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"7344","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"108","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"108","code":"energy","name":"Energy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:45","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:45"}},{"id":"7345","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"150","order":"8","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"7346","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1532","code":"africa-and-the-eu","user_id":"1","title":"Africa and the EU","abstract":"<p>Working paper The EU and Africa:&nbsp;Regionalism and interregionalism beyond institutions, by&nbsp;Nicoletta Pirozzi,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

Nevertheless, if we look at the reality of their achievements, it emerges that the two organizations evolved at different pace, with the AU lagging behind, also due to the fact that the integration process in the two regions is confronted with different challenges.In terms of interregional relations, it appears that the EU has heavily influenced the development of regionalism in Africa mainly through teaching and support.

His current research focuses on the role and functions of science-based policy institutes or \"think tanks\" in theory and practice, the interactions among policy domains and international relations, and global governance on environment, resources, climate and energy<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: <\/strong><strong>What do you see when you look at the energy sector through an Atlantic lens?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: The world&rsquo;s energy systems are Atlantic. This is true for coal, the fuel that started the industrial revolution and powered industry and especially mining. It is also true for other fossil energy carriers: oil including shale oil and tar sands and methane. The nuclear industry started in the WWII era in the North Atlantic and financially sustained by Atlantic government subsidies before going global.&nbsp; The recent onset of fracking is an essentially North American phenomenon.<\/p>\r\n<p>Early development of renewable energy technologies including solar energy and wind turbines started in the US before globalizing. Bio-energy at industrial scale is also of Atlantic provenance, from sugar cane to alcohol as transport fuel in Brazil, corn-to-ethanol for fuel blending in the US, to canola (rape seed) to bio-diesel or general agricultural waste to biogas to bio-genic electricity in the EU.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: <\/strong><strong>What are the trends and dynamics of energy in the Atlantic space?&nbsp; <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: Nuclear power and fossil energies are declining due to generally rising long-term costs. Many companies are heading for write-downs, economic abandonment or insolvency and possible government bail-outs. The Atlantic nations have overdeveloped both fossil and nuclear energy, incurring enormous political and security costs, e.g. climate change.<\/p>\r\n<p>Renewable energy development and use is increasing, but at different rates and sometimes from a low starting basis. Cost improvements result from new inventions, material discoveries as well as technological, business, and policy learning curves, particularly for solar energy and storage. The roll-out of IT-based technology is accelerating both in relation to existing technologies and the investment and development of new energy systems. This transformation is proving disruptive to the old, dirty and dangerous fossil and nuclear energy industries. The Age of Energy Transformation away from fossil and nuclear towards renewable energy supply with storage in a smart grid is originally an Atlantic phenomenon, conceived as an idea by Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute in the US, and now epitomised by the German \"Energiewende\" entering practically all Atlantic languages.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What does the Atlantic future energy system look like?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: While the true costs of fossil and nuclear systems are becoming ever more obvious, pressure mounts for public budgets to phase-out the perverse subsidies that favour them. Energy efficiency, renewable and storage technologies are becoming ever cheaper. As a consequence, energy-related trade and investment patterns will change. Instead of energy carriers such as coal and gas being traded, it will be equipment for renewable power generation and storage for various kinds. The total cost of energy supply will decline, and asset values of energy infrastructure will fall. More energy will be consumed close to the point of production.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;What are the trigger points of potential cooperation in the Atlantic space?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: Atlantic nations should cooperate to accelerate the energy transformation. A key measure is reforming energy-related taxation, including scrapping perverse subsidies and privileges for fossil and nuclear energy. Governments should agree to facilitate the trade in goods and services relating to energy efficiency, renewable energies, storage and smart grids. Tariffs still imposed should be removed, perhaps by \"coordinated unilateralism\".&nbsp; Local, regional or national content obligations in government procurement rules should be scrapped. In order to facilitate the trade in biogenic energy, stringent sustainability criteria should be agreed for the production and processing of biomass. The Atlantic nations might follow the \"top-runner\" approach so that the best practice concerning energy efficiency or energy conversion in any one country or company becomes the norm after 3 or 5 years. That would speed invention, innovation and dissemination of desirable technologies throughout the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the Atlantic Voices here:<\/strong><\/p>","views":"952","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-10-08 17:13:00","modified":"2016-02-08 04:00:01"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"171","content_id":"1131","type":"1","file_name":"1131-ATLANTIC VOICES_02_R.A.

With this objective in mind regional trends and dynamics have been presented and analysed in this paper. However, interviewees not only had particular difficulty thinking about the Atlantic in terms of a unified geopolitical space but also agreed that, for the time being at least, we could not speak of the emergence of this geopolitical space. Because, despite the common ground that exists among the regions of the Atlantic, the context of international reconfiguration being experienced today, and the prevalence of national and regional dynamics still have direct impact on the social and political mindset of the Atlantic sub-regions.

Fundamental changes are taking place within and between Atlantic countries, yet many of these are eclipsed by, or ultimately part of, growing globalization and multipolarity. These may be accompanied by the relative decline of the European Union as it turns inward to meet internal challenges and as political and economic gravities shift. Historical and cultural ties provide a deep foundation for interregional cooperation between Atlantic countries on issues such as trade, drug trafficking, and governance of shared commons.&nbsp; Yet whether these ties can form the basis for a new &ldquo;Atlantic Rim,&rdquo; or whether instead the dynamics and trends within the Atlantic herald an increasingly interconnected and globalized world whereby the relevance of these linkages weakens, remains to be seen.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the two papers here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"162","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-10-07 10:17:00","modified":"2016-02-03 05:20:35"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"145","content_id":"1108","type":"1","file_name":"1108-ATLANTIC FUTURE_Perspectives from IO in Geneva.pdf","description":"Perspectives from International Organizations in Geneva (by Paula de Castro, CIDOB)","created":"2015-09-08 10:18:02","modified":"2015-09-08 10:18:02"},{"id":"146","content_id":"1108","type":"1","file_name":"1108-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from New York and Washington.pdf","description":"Perspectives from International Organizations in New York and Washington, D.C.

GMF and FRIDE, with their respective offices used their networks to interview the relevant actors based on their professional and academic expertise. The main concerns regarding the current state and future of the Atlantic region included, amongst others: the future of the TTIP trade negotiation between the US and the EU, the lack of a cohesive &ldquo;Atlantic&rdquo; security approach, the struggle for a united and common energy and climate and environmental policy within the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from France <\/strong>(by Danielle Piatkiewicz and Bruno Medroa, GMF)<\/p>\r\n<p>The Atlantic Future project explores the concept that new relations are emerging in the Atlantic space beyond the traditional North Atlantic alliance and the North-South dependency. GMF, with their respective office in Paris, France, used their networks to interview the relevant actors based on their professional and academic expertise. The main consensus on the emergence of a pan- Atlantic space was mixed. The main concerns on the current and future state of the Atlantic region from the Paris perspective touched on the following;&nbsp; future of the trade and investment, along with the negotiation of free trade agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the U.S. and the EU. The respondents identified the need for different priorities between North and South Atlantic. It was strongly expressed that Europe and the U.S. remain the most important actors for the global economy, along with China and India. However, countries like Brazil or South Africa have been rising as economic models rather than as economic powers, and show an increased influence from the Southern Atlantic countries.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Portugal <\/strong>(by Daniel Marcos,IPRI-NOVA University)<\/p>\r\n<p>The creation of a pan-Atlantic space, based on cooperation between the different regions of the Atlantic is fundamental for the future of the Atlantic basin, capable to deal with the emergence of new powers in the Asia-Pacific Rim and the threats that emerged with the end of the Cold War: terrorism, migration trends, illicit trafficking, fragile states, etc. The analysis of four specific areas &ndash; economy and finances, security, people and institutions, resources and environment &ndash; has shown the existence of different stages of development of the Atlantic basin countries, mainly between the North and the South, which must be overcome by cooperation in these same areas. For Portuguese stakeholders, the European Union, African Union and NATO have a fundamental role to play, but EU is mostly seen as a role model to be followed for the development of regional and interregional cooperation. The challenge is to overcome the lack of leadership of EU in the last 5 years and the traditional suspicion of the South Atlantic regarding to the North in order to deepen the relations between the shores of the Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Spain <\/strong>(by Susanne Gratius, FRIDE)<\/p>\r\n<p>The perceptions and opinions of Spanish stakeholders on the Atlantic are highly diverse but coincide in the need to include Latin America in Transatlantic relations. Most interviewees in Spain focused on economic aspects and security interests in the Atlantic, while people and institutions, resources and environment ranked second. The overwhelming majority of interviewees shared a rather sceptical view on the future of the Atlantic as an articulated and institutionalized space or a community of values. There was also a consensus on the view that Latin America is part of the Atlantic identity, while Africa is more distant in terms of values and norms, development and common interest. The North-South divide is still present, but most interviewees agreed on the need for a more balanced and horizontal relationship taking into account the power shifts towards regional leaders like Brazil, Mexico or South Africa, on the one hand, and multinational companies and &ldquo;global civil society networks, on the other.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Germany&nbsp;<\/strong>(by Christoph H. Stefes,Ecologic Institute Berlin)<\/p>\r\n<p>The twenty individuals from Germany interviewed for this project emphasized the critical importance of transatlantic relations for Europe. Despite its relative decline in power, the United States is still considered Europe&rsquo;s most important security and economic partner. The interviewees accordingly emphasized the need to conclude the current TTIP negotiations successfully. The emergence of a pan-Atlantic community on the other hand met more scepticism, as interviewees pointed towards the still existing lack of consolidated liberal democracies and resilient markets in Latin America and even more so in Africa. Moreover, they perceived a lack of common values and shared interests across the regions of the South Atlantic and the regions of the North Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Italy&nbsp;<\/strong>(by Andrea Dess&igrave; and Chiara Rosselli,Istituto Affari Internazionali)<\/p>\r\n<p>On the whole sceptical about the notion of an emerging pan-Atlantic space, Italian stakeholders converged around the necessity of strengthening the transatlantic relationship as the primary means to ensure a continued relevance on the world stage and greater conformity to EU-US norms and standards among Atlantic countries. While impossible to ignore the rising influence of Asia and China in the Atlantic, Europe and the US maintain certain margins of influence and leverage within this space. Supportive of the TTIP, stakeholders emphasised Europe&rsquo;s internal divisions, a lack of trust and the persistence of paternalism in North-South relations as the primary obstacles for the emergence of closer cooperation among Atlantic countries.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Poland <\/strong>(by Corinna H\u04e7rst and Danielle Piatkiewicz,GMF)<\/p>\r\n<p>The concept of a new pan-Atlantic system of relations emerging in the Atlantic space beyond the traditional North Atlantic alliance and the North-South dependency has captured the Atlantic space. Polish interviewees from Warsaw viewed the idea with a measure of scepticism. Although there was no unanimous opinion, many interviewees from various sectors in Warsaw appeared to be sceptical about this potential scenario stating that the lack of a unified EU and Europe could prevent this idea from forming. The German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) and their Warsaw based office used their networks to interview the relevant actors based on their professional and academic expertise. The overall main concerns regarding the current state and future of the Atlantic region included, amongst others: the current and future state of transatlantic relations, the future of the TTIP trade negotiation between the US and the EU, the lack of a cohesive &ldquo;Atlantic&rdquo; security approach, the U.S.&rsquo;s shift towards other regions, and the lack of a cohesive energy and climate and environmental policy both within the EU and the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from the UK <\/strong>(by Sangeeta Khorana and Christina Stolte)<\/p>\r\n<p>Interviews in London informed us about the stakeholders&rsquo; perceptions in four thematic areas of the Atlantic Future project, which include: economy and finance, security, people and institutions, resources and environment. Main themes of focus were: changes over the past 20 years; drivers for change or continuity; prospective view of the changes and continuities in the region; actors and regional leaders (state or non-state level); relevance of the EU; perceptions on the evolution of the EU&rsquo;s role in the region over the past 20 years; and finally the convergence or divergence of norms within the Atlantic space. Based on the interview results in the UK, the paper reports that developments in the Atlantic have led to a proliferation of economic and non-economic initiatives amongst various Atlantic actors, both in the North and South. In the North, the North Atlantic community and the USA and EU is undergoing major changes in economic, security and political terms. Following the spectacular rise of Brazil and Africa, the focus has been gradually shifting from the EU and USA and new dynamics is evolving in the Atlantic space. However, a Pan Atlantic space is not really emerging but if the ongoing Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and USA were successful this could herald the beginning of a new Atlantic space. The EU is and continues to be an important player in the Atlantic, and is likely to play an influential role in the reconfiguration of the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from the Netherlands <\/strong>(by Lucy Olivia Smith,Ecologic Institute Berlin)<\/p>\r\n<p>Twenty individuals from the Netherlands were interviewed for this report on transatlantic geopolitics. While the North-Atlantic relationships between Europe and the US remains strong and established in issues related to security and economy, the project sought to gauge whether there was a budding pan-Atlantic community. Rather than confirm this idea, the interviewees highlighted the emergence of substantial emerging economies in Latin America and Africa and through this observation, emphasized the increasing polarity of the international community that is increasingly defined by diverse axis of power and significance and less so by traditional power blocs. While some specific topics had a distinctly Atlantic dimension, such as the issue of immigration and drug trafficking, most matters related to economy and security were firmly entrenched in the reality of a truly globalised world. When forming ideas of how Europe could maintain relevance, several interviewees saw the EU as a model for supra-national governance structures and demilitarisation and as defining itself in a soft power role.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the nine papers here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"166","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-10-07 07:55:00","modified":"2016-02-06 21:57:23"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"149","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-AF_WP7_ Deliverable 7.2.pdf","description":"Introduction","created":"2015-09-08 10:57:01","modified":"2015-09-08 10:57:01"},{"id":"150","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from Belgium_Brussels.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Brussels (by Elisa Lled\u00f3, FRIDE, and Danielle Piatkiewicz, GMF)","created":"2015-09-08 10:57:36","modified":"2015-09-08 10:57:36"},{"id":"151","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspecties from France_ Paris.pdf","description":"Perspectives from France (by Danielle Piatkiewicz and Bruno Medroa, GMF)","created":"2015-09-08 10:58:00","modified":"2015-09-08 10:58:00"},{"id":"152","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from Portugal.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Portugal (by Daniel Marcos, IPRI-NOVA University)","created":"2015-09-08 10:58:22","modified":"2015-09-08 10:58:22"},{"id":"153","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from Spain_ Madrid.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Spain (by Susanne Gratius, FRIDE)","created":"2015-09-08 10:59:03","modified":"2015-09-08 10:59:03"},{"id":"154","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from Germany.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Germany (by Christoph H.

and perceptions on the Atlantic space across the American continent. The papers expose the results of interviews carried out in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia and Honduras, and US and Canada. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>","body":"<p><strong>Perspectives from Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela <\/strong>(In&ecirc;s Sousa, FGV &ndash; NPII)<\/p>\r\n<p>This paper explores the perspectives of Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela on the potential emergence of a pan-Atlantic system of relations beyond the North-North alliance and North South dependency. Interviews were conducted with specialists from various sectors in each of the aforementioned countries. We found a consensus on the perspective that increasing political and economic links between South America and Africa are being established. The increase in Chinese investments in South America and Africa is considered to be determinant to the on-going political and economic transformations taking place in the Atlantic basin.&nbsp; The role of EU is considered relevant, seen as a potential mediator and an actor able to somewhat balance US influence as well as Chinese presence in South America and Africa. Overall, a pan-Atlantic system of relations is not considered to be taking shape. All point out to the (political, social, economic, cultural&hellip;) differences found in the South Atlantic itself, as well as in relation to the North. The present findings should be considered by the EU when designing its external policies and initiatives involving Southern countries. It is our assessment that any venture that disregards the views observed during this research and summarized here would most likely not be successful.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Mexico, Colombia and Honduras<\/strong> (by Mark Aspinwall, Elsy Gonz&aacute;lez &amp; Lorena Ruano, CIDE)<\/p>\r\n<p>This paper reports on the findings of field interviews with elites in Mexico, Colombia, and Honduras. Interviewees were questioned on their views of the relevance of issues, partners, cooperation and conflict across the Atlantic space. Key topics mentioned repeatedly by interviewees across the three countries were migration, drug trafficking, and the importance of the USA as a global partner. In the area of security, all interviewees see the USA as the principal actor, with terrorism and fragile states as the main threats. In the environment, the thinking of interviewees was more global than regional, but all saw climate change as the main issue. In terms of trade and finance, liberalization and cooperation were the predominant lines of thinking, while in people and institutions, democratization and migration were key topics. Democracy, markets, and cooperation were seen as common values across the Atlantic. Prospects for cooperation would be improved if Northern states and regions paid more attention to the South, according to the interviewees, but there was also a significant current of opinion that Latin America (and more particularly, some of its main actors, like Brazil and Colombia) is emerging in its own right.&nbsp;Prospects for an Atlantic partnership seem slim, and there does not seem to be an automatic perception of the Atlantic as a relevant geopolitical concept, though there is no consensus on what is the most important obstacle. Some say it is cultural differences and government inconsistency and indifference, while others blame financing problems. Language, distance, transportation, infrastructure, poor management of aid funding, time zones, and culture were all mentioned. However, the regions of the Atlantic are seen as relevant units of study. Cooperation within Latin America was seen as valuable in order to prevent exploitation by the North. Notwithstanding this pessimism, in each of the three countries, two-thirds of elites say that an Atlantic Rim is taking shape. Public sector and academic officials are more likely to say yes, while private sector, media and NGO officials are more mixed. Likewise, opinion about the utility and benefits of Atlantic cooperation in all three states is very favorable, especially so in Honduras.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Canada and the United States&nbsp;<\/strong>(by Daniel S. Hamilton<strong>, <\/strong>Center for Transatlantic Relations, Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies)<\/p>\r\n<p>Canadian and American opinion leaders are aware of many changing dynamics affecting the countries and peoples of the broad Atlantic space, yet do not have a uniform view of what such changes mean for pan-Atlantic cooperation or the emergence of a broad ''Atlantic'' consciousness. Most believe that there will be greater cooperation in the Atlantic in the next 5 to 15 years, but also believe that informal networks are more likely to be effective that formal structures to facilitate such cooperation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the three papers here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"107","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-10-06 10:13:00","modified":"2016-02-06 15:01:26"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"142","content_id":"1107","type":"1","file_name":"1107-ATLANTIC FUTURE_WP7_Perspectives from Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela (In\u00eas Sousa, FGV \u2013 NPII) ","created":"2015-09-08 10:14:06","modified":"2015-09-08 10:14:06"},{"id":"143","content_id":"1107","type":"1","file_name":"1107-ATLANTIC FUTURE_WP7_Perspectives from Mexico, Colombia and Honduras.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Mexico, Colombia and Honduras (by Mark Aspinwall, Elsy Gonz\u00e1lez & Lorena Ruano, CIDE)","created":"2015-09-08 10:15:21","modified":"2015-09-08 10:15:21"},{"id":"144","content_id":"1107","type":"1","file_name":"1107-ATLANTIC FUTURE_WP7_Perspectives from Canada and the United States.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Canada and the United States (by Daniel S.

Through multiple interviews with representatives from a wide spectrum of Angola&rsquo;s society, the main trends, risks and opportunities in this area are explored while the role of norms and values, cooperation and regionalism as potential drivers of further relations are weighted in and evaluated.

Covering representatives from various sectors in society, the analysed interviews reveal how divergence and convergence is perceived in terms of economics, institutions, energy and security. The findings reveal a very cautious approach to the idea of an Atlantic space. The priorities of political imaginations appear to be centred on national interests and on the rise of Asia in the global order, leaving very little excitement for a project with regions that are either seen as dominant (Europe and North America) or unknown (South America). The strengthening of an Atlantic identity and of a potential Pan-Atlantic institution will therefore require a decided change of perception among the targeted actors in West Africa, Cameroon and South Africa towards the other Atlantic regions. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Morocco&nbsp;<\/strong>(by&nbsp;Sqalli Hammad, HEM-CESEM)<\/p>\r\n<p>This paper presents Moroccan perspectives and perceptions of the construction of a pan-Atlantic space. Findings are based on 20 interviews covering 4 thematic areas: economy and finance, security, people and institutions, resources and environment. They show the multileveled complexity of the issues at hand and the near absence of a vision of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, emergent initiatives are not counteracting an Atlantic will. Moroccans are not anywhere near an Atlantic project aimed at integrating economies and people; domestic issues and new African perspective seem to take precedence over an immediate pan-Atlantic configuration.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Cape Verde<\/strong> (Katarina Pereira da Costa, HEM-CESEM)<\/p>\r\n<p>The interviews were carried out in Cape Verde using a standardised questionnaire developed by the Atlantic Future project. The interviewee&rsquo;s were people (of both genders) from the public sector, private sector, academia, media and civil society and the interviews covered the thematic areas of economy and finance, security, people and institutions and resources and environment subject of study of the Atlantic Future project. Most interviewees perceived a pan-Atlantic space taking shape or at least they expressed their desire that it could emerge would be happening. They saw a movement towards cooperation especially in economics and security. Many suggestions were made on how to stimulate the creation of a pan-Atlantic space by those who did not forseen a pan-Atlantic taking shape yet or whom believed it is still a very insignificant

manifold and mutually reinforcing. This paper examines the dynamics of four key environment and resources issues, looking to the 2020\/2025 horizon: climate mitigation and energy transformations; food security; overfishing; and wildlife trafficking and biodiversity loss. Each is global in nature, yet Atlantic actors play influential roles and have shared interests in, and critical resources for, addressing them. Underlying these challenges are regional and global drivers of resource consumption and production. Rising demand for resources to feed growing and wealthier populations is shifting global production and consumption patterns, and in turn, creating heavy environmental strain. Where policy solutions prove insufficient to internalize costs, economic interests will continue to drive unsustainable, and often illegal, resource use and consumption. Nevertheless, despite negative trajectories in many areas, the Atlantic Space offers unique opportunities for concerted action and furthering networks of state and non-state actors to address the environmental challenges of today and of the future through coordinated regional action.<\/p>","views":"251","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-09-11 17:08:00","modified":"2016-01-31 22:41:04"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"163","content_id":"1113","type":"1","file_name":"1113-WP9_Ecologic_Patterns of Production and Consumption in the Atlantic Space and Future Environment and Resource Scenarios.pdf","description":"Patterns of Production and Consumption in the Atlantic Space and Future Environment and Resource Scenarios","created":"2015-09-10 17:20:20","modified":"2015-09-10 17:20:20"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"6351","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"6344","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"162","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"162","code":"resources","name":"resources","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"6345","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"107","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"107","code":"climate-change","name":"Climate change","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:29","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:29"}},{"id":"6346","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"108","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"108","code":"energy","name":"Energy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:45","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:45"}},{"id":"6347","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"163","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"163","code":"food-security","name":"food security","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"6348","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"211","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"211","code":"illicit-trafficking","name":"illicit trafficking","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"6349","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"109","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"109","code":"environment","name":"Environment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:06:53","modified":"2013-09-27 11:06:53"}},{"id":"6350","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"242","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"242","code":"food-production","name":"food production","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"6351","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1115","code":"atlantics-emerging-security-challenges","user_id":"1","title":"Atlantic\u2019s Emerging Security Challenges","abstract":"<p>In much contrast to the territorial disputes and military tensions defining the Pacific Rim, the Atlantic remains a relatively stable geo-political sphere, largely due to the lack of great power conflict.

Cooperation in the Atlantic Basin will probably take place &lsquo;<em>&agrave; la carte&rsquo;<\/em>, rather than on the basis of a clear all-encompassing institutional design. Democracy is the prevalent form of government across the Atlantic, but with major regional variations and a predominance of hybrid or authoritarian regimes in Africa. Socio-economic challenges also differ considerably among Atlantic countries. Social inequalities within countries have been growing larger in recent years in both advanced and developing countries. Demography will be a critical factor for the future of the Atlantic, with Africa being the only region where high population growth rates are expected and Europe being the fastest ageing region. Beyond states, the influence of multinational companies, NGOs, social networks, sub-national entities (cities, regions) and migrant communities over government decisions and within multilateral organisations and fora is set to grow. Therefore, future convergence in the Atlantic Basin cannot be planned top-down, but needs to encompass and build on the perspectives and priorities of societal actors, from the bottom up.&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"91","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-09-10 17:11:00","modified":"2016-02-06 10:09:48"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"164","content_id":"1114","type":"1","file_name":"1114-WP9_FRIDE_Political, social and cultural trends in the Atlantic.pdf","description":"Political, social and cultural trends in the Atlantic","created":"2015-09-10 17:21:38","modified":"2015-09-10 17:21:38"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"6212","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},{"id":"6206","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"85","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"85","code":"culture","name":"Culture","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:54:50","modified":"2013-09-27 10:54:50"}},{"id":"6207","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"24","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"24","code":"political-relations","name":"Political relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:04:54","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:54"}},{"id":"6208","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"99","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"99","code":"political-systems","name":"Political systems","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:58:08","modified":"2013-09-27 10:58:08"}},{"id":"6209","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"272","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"272","code":"development-gap","name":"development gap","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"6210","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"23","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"23","code":"social-relations","name":"Social relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:08:58","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:58"}},{"id":"6211","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"273","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"273","code":"non-governmental-actors","name":"non governmental actors","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"6212","content_id":"1114","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"944","code":"webinar-regionalisms-across-the-atlantic1","user_id":"1","title":"Webinar: Regionalisms across the Atlantic","abstract":"<p>The second Atlantic Future webinar <strong>&ldquo;Regionalisms across the Atlantic: divergences and convergences<\/strong>&rdquo; took place on 22 June and was conducted by <strong>Dr Frank Mattheis<\/strong>, Senior Researcher at the Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation at the University of Pretoria, and Atlantic Future partner.

E.g. Pacific Alliance and Eastern Africa. Would you say that is true?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>South American countries, such as Brazil emphasize the fact that the South Atlantic dynamics are very different from the North Atlantic.

The seminar, entitled &ldquo;<strong>The Future of the Atlantic: Common dynamics or different paths?<\/strong>&rdquo;was held in the margins of the ATLANTIC FUTURE Plenary Meeting in Lisbon and aimed to discuss the present and the future of the Atlantic basin taking into account the transformations that we have assisted in the last twenty years. While the relations between the North America and Europe remained very strong, we are witnessing a strong growth of Africa and Latin America. Their weight in the international system has grown in relevance in areas such as economy, energy, security, human and institutional development and environment. In the meantime, we are observing a tremendous growth in Asia-Pacific area and with emerging powers like China becoming relevant actors in the Atlantic space.<\/p>","body":"<p>The Lunch Seminar sought to reinforce the interest of postgraduate students from universities in Lisbon (Institute of Social Sciences &ndash; University of Lisbon; Institute of Social and an Political Sciences &ndash; University of Lisbon; Institute for Political Studies of the Catholic University; School of Social and Human Sciences of the NOVA University of Lisbon; University Institute of Lisbon) working already in the Atlantic to deepen their research interests on the topic. Chaired by Daniel Marcos from IPRI-NOVA, the seminar begun with his remarks on the importance of the Atlantic and then gave the floor to three experts: Victor Borges, Former Cape Verde Foreign Minister; Dorval Brunelle, Professor at the University of Quebec in Montreal and Carlos Gaspar, member of the board of the IPRI-NOVA and Professor at the NOVA University of Lisbon.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Victor Borges presentation focused on four main ideas: 1) recognizing the existence of different interests and perspectives in the Atlantic; 2) setting the grounds for the discussion of the Atlantic; 3) building up common concerns; and 4) working together (States, regional and inter-regional entities and even international institutions, like the UN through the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea). According to him, to develop a better future it is necessary to take into account the past and to understand the present. Focusing on the features of the past, he spoke of the economic supremacy of the North, the European expeditions, the slavery and natural resources exploitation that had a huge impact on the North-South relations. Regarding the present, today&rsquo;s profound development divide is also important - too much dependency and poverty in the South while the North has some sort of convergence; and the political, economic, territorial and military presence of North powers in the South. But despite obvious strategic differences, Victor Borges defended that there is space to harmonize the relation between the North and the South with common grounds and cooperation, focusing on national and regional security, human security, economics, trade, energy supply, food security, maritime protection, drug trafficking and other illegal activities. Later, he defended that to understand which players should build a common future it is important to take into account institutional players like states, but also regional entities and non-institutional players. This will lead to a wide Atlantic area with peace, security, stability and acceptable governance, common values and legality instead of power, and regional and interregional coordination.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/847-1430814260.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Dorval Brunelle started his presentation by setting the grounds for the Atlantic Future project, to &ldquo;where did it came and where it will go?&rdquo;, warning of the problems of a state centric approach of the future of the Atlantic or the limitations of the international level analysis. He highlighted the relevance of the local level analysis, focusing on the pollution, fishermen, oil rigs, the users of the ocean and that have a huge impact in the Atlantic. Focusing on the conceptual tools, he identified cities as very important actors. The problems of the Atlantic are happening at local level. Dorval Brunelle believes that two opposing trends are happening in the ocean space: the &ldquo;maritimisation of territory&rdquo; and a &ldquo;territorialisation of maritime space&rdquo;. The first one focusing on the security of maritime lines, the supply by sea routes and sea transport is much cheaper than by land &ndash; the water doesn&rsquo;t cost anything. The second focuses on the conflicting claims the seas have been object of. The land and ocean space share common grounds so it is important to construct a new way to see the interface between ocean and land, to limit the misuse of the ocean. Finally, to rethink the Atlantic he believes that it is important to include the geographers, develop new programmes that do not jump from the local to the regional and international level and that can give us new ways to see the sea.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/847-1430814653.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>At the end, Carlos Gaspar raised the question about the Atlantic being an autonomous entity in international politics. According to him, it can be seen as 1) an organized system, a &ldquo;region of regions&rdquo; with no regional conflict among regional great powers; 2) a democratic system &ndash; all four regions are led by democratic powers and a great majority of the regions member states are pluralist democracies; 3) with relevant historical and cultural convergence between all regions of the Atlantic. All of this allows common dynamics leading to the peaceful convergence of the main regional actors. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that the Atlantic constitute a regional entity. The factors that are at the basis of the North Atlantic alliance differ from those that shaped the relation between the rest of the Atlantic and the convergence common to the four regions cannot be taken for granted: it works to balance the expansion of Asia and to face the escalation of conflicts between the major powers in the Indo-Pacific system, defining itself as a pole of stability in the international system.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>After this, the lunch was served, during which the students exchanged views with the speakers and with the partners of the ATLANTIC FUTURE.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"261","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-05-05 09:41:00","modified":"2016-02-08 16:44:16"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"5261","content_id":"847","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"5255","content_id":"847","tag_id":"246","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"246","code":"lisbon","name":"lisbon","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"5256","content_id":"847","tag_id":"54","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"54","code":"perspectives","name":"Perspectives","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:43:59","modified":"2013-09-27 10:43:59"}},{"id":"5257","content_id":"847","tag_id":"147","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"147","code":"international-relations","name":"international relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-11-18 11:32:59","modified":"2013-11-18 11:32:59"}},{"id":"5258","content_id":"847","tag_id":"5","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"5","code":"atlantic-space","name":"Atlantic space","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:55:08","modified":"2013-09-27 09:55:08"}},{"id":"5259","content_id":"847","tag_id":"15","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"5260","content_id":"847","tag_id":"53","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"53","code":"north-atlantic","name":"North Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:53:35","modified":"2013-09-27 11:53:35"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"5261","content_id":"847","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"837","code":"public-event-in-lisbon","user_id":"1","title":"Public event in Lisbon","abstract":"<p>The ATLANTIC FUTURE third plenary meeting was held in Lisboa, Portugal, on 22-24 April 2015 and hosted by IPRI-NOVA.&nbsp;The meeting started with a public event on &ldquo;Setting the Grounds for a New Understanding of the Atlantic&rdquo;.

Teixeira opened the floor by welcoming the assistants and by presenting the speakers. He then spoke of the Atlantic by referring how the end of the Cold War accelerated democratisation in the Atlantic. As a result, there is a new homogeneity in the interaction between US, Brazil, Europe, Africa and Latin America. There is recognition of common interests in international security issues, an increase in economic exchange, and growing linkages in several areas. Overall, there is more interaction in the broad Atlantic area.<\/p>\r\n<p>He wondered what the challenges of the future are. These changes need to be institutionally and politically translated in order to create and Atlantic community. The Atlantic continues to benefit from a certain institutionalisation of the Atlantic relations. But in the South, emerging powers adopt a strategy of greater autonomy. In the long term, this may be beneficial to other areas, namely to Asia (China). The South Atlantic has emerged as an area of economic prosperity and energy production (Brazil, Nigeria, and Angola, among others). There is a diversification of the type of relations in the Atlantic, not only the traditional North-South but also new relations South-South in which Brazil has been playing a very important role. We are seeing the emergence of a new pan-Atlantic system of relations in the Atlantic Basin, far beyond the two traditional relations in the Atlantic: the alliance between Europe and the US and the traditional dependence North-South. &nbsp;However, according to Nuno S. Teixeira, a new pan-Atlantic system of relations is a vision, but it is a vision without a strategy. It is a vision without the instruments of multilateral institutionalisation of the system of these new relations. Something that is absolutely fundamental for future cooperation. According to him, this is the main challenge we face today and our aim with this project is to try to contribute to this vision and to this strategy, trying to build an Atlantic unity for the future.<\/p>\r\n<p>Jordi Bacaria presented the Atlantic Future project, highlighting the European Commission funding and support in the research. Jordi Bacaria overviewed the project with the main outputs and the work ahead. He placed the project and the Atlantic in the context of latest developments such as the negotiations of the TTIP or the creation of the Development Bank.<\/p>\r\n<p>Dan Hamilton started his intervention by pointing that there is a lot more going on in the Atlantic space that is generally understood. Globalisation is not limited to the Pacific. Most of the media and political discourse seems to conflate what is going on in Asia (mainly China) with globalisation. Hamilton clarified that both are much related, but globalisation does not only happen in China. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>To support his statement he highlighted a few key areas. The Atlantic provides as much energy to the world as the Middle East, and the trends in the Atlantic are much more dynamic. In trade, the Atlantic is still where most trade takes place. Trade and goods are still very strong in the North Atlantic, and also between South American and Europe and South America and North America. South-South exchanges are still the weakest, though it is true that these are the most dynamic. Demand is going to find a new way, and ports are scrambling to take on big tankers. An example of that, Dan Hamilton, mentioned how &nbsp;Houston-Texas, has become the largest city export in the US. &ldquo;People in Texas think they are Atlantic&rdquo;, said Hamilton. Trade in goods is getting increasingly Pacific; however, services are a more Atlantic phenomenon, especially in the North Atlantic, and investment is still an Atlantic phenomenon. Finally, Dan Hamilton added that the expansion of the Panama Canal and the melting of the Arctic are creating new transportation passages.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/837-1430296596.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Albeit these are the most prominent areas, Dan Hamilton considered that other areas are &nbsp;also worth exploring: 1) the Atlantic Ocean, as there are issues that are specific to the Atlantic Ocean. Globalisation dynamics are creating all sorts of new challenges such as rising sea levels in the Atlantic coast faster than anywhere else, pollution, overfishing where no regimes to take care for the full Atlantic, with no governance structures, among many others; 2) Maritime securities; and 3) Challenges to human security. He further referred to values in the Atlantic. In his view, there is no contestation of values in the region, as most people in the Atlantic agree and aspire to the same values. Although this does not mean that these are achieved, there is a common type of orientation. In the Pacific, on the contrary, there is much more contestation of values.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">Thus the Atlantic becomes a laboratory. The Atlantic does not have the cleavages of the Pacific, so there is an opportunity to be a laboratory of governance. Beyond the North-South line, the Atlantic could pave the way and could be a pioneer. This is far beyond where we are today. It is true that disintegrative trends are there but, according to Dan Hamilton, opportunities are here as well. &nbsp;The Atlantic is half of the world. Therefore, if there is an Asian hemisphere, there is also an Atlantic hemisphere. We think of ocean basins, and the connections that those oceans create are a new way of thinking. Hamilton warned that disintegrative trends are the easiest to take us forward. The Atlantic, however, would be poor if we let these tendencies win. This is where the real battle is.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>After the speakers&rsquo; presentation, an interesting debate ensued with the audience. On the United States pivot to the Pacific, Dan Hamilton wondered why the US could not use both vocations: the Atlantic and the Pacific ones. The same happens with Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and all South America. He said that the US is the pivot. It is still so despite relative decline. So from a purely US point of view, the US should enhance the position in the Pacific and also look at the Atlantic. The US has failed to become an Atlantic power and it is instead a North Atlantic power. For Dan Hamilton, the US should reposition itself in this world of diffuse power more pan-Atlantic than in the Pacific. From a security perspective, Dan Hamilton added that the correlation between societal developments, illicit traffic of drugs, humans and weapons with fragile states structure is one of the global challenges of the region -especially in Africa and Latin America. Therefore, he added that transposing institutions for part of the Atlantic Southward is not the way to go.<\/p>\r\n<p>He was asked on legacies in the Atlantic. Victor Borges reflected how there are common features in the Atlantic such as languages or culture, and yet there are also negative things that are still lingering and that reverberates in the present. If these are not managed correctly, these will shape the future. We can see a big picture of homogeneous Atlantic, but we need to go deeper to see the details that can make the difference. The problem is who is going to lead. Whose perspective is going to be placed in the middle to develop this new wider Atlantic? To this reflection, Dan Hamilton added that certainly in the Atlantic we have to deal with legacies. But, he said, continuing in the same mould does not allow us to get beyond this type of thinking. If it is not managed in the right way it is going to backfire us. There is ample opportunity of new infrastructure, there are new things happening and some pioneering work could be done.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/837-1430296475.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Hamilton said that the idea of the Atlantic space will not succeed if it is not shared by people in Brazil, in Africa, etc. It has to be driven &ldquo;by Southern demand&rdquo;, he added. The bigger efforts are in the South more than in the North for this reason. Can we get out of the North-South boxes, even from the BRICS boxes? The Atlantic frame could be a new window to overcome the North\/South way of seeing things, as the traditional frame will no longer work.<\/p>\r\n<p>Asked on the extent to which current and future trade relations will impact on the Atlantic, particularly on the TTIP and its potential disruptive power, seen as the North trying again to exert a leading role, Dan Hamilton pointed that the TTIP is not happening in isolation. A TPP is also being negotiated. He referred to TTIP as another effort to spring loose the multilateral system in another way. By advancing in these areas, it is an assertive effort by US and EU that should work for everyone. The question is whether it is open: leaders have not said that this is open to others, and this is the mistake. They have said it in the Pacific, but not for the TTIP. It is about the norms, standards, rules, that will guide us into the future, he added.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hamilton referred to the importance of a non-governmental approach. In the world we face, the public-private network is more relevant than state to state. Despite differences, he said, things can be done. Years ago people looked at Pacific and thought that something could be done, and as a result nowadays APEC exists. The Pacific is a much more diverse region with greater challenges than the Atlantic. There could be different forms of collaboration in the Atlantic. Networks become the more relevant angle to look at some of the current challenges. There is an opportunity to explore.<\/p>\r\n<p>Jordi Bacaria finished by adding that the Atlantic Future project itself tries to build epistemic communities. He reflected on the fact that if all projects are born in the North, we will have a Northern perspective. We need to have more projects in the South, he said. Otherwise, the perspective will always be North Atlantic. Nevertheless, he also pointed out that this is changing.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>After the public debate, the seminar continued with a roundtable with Maria Raquel Freire (University of Coimbra), Tiago Moreira de S&aacute; and Emanuel Joaquim (IPRI). The experts presented their research on Russian foreign policy and on the US and the Azores, and elaborated on the implications for the Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/837-1430296622.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>","views":"297","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-04-29 10:24:00","modified":"2016-02-08 04:24:10"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"130","content_id":"837","type":"1","file_name":"837-Lisboa_Setting the Grounds_public event.pdf","description":"Public event report","created":"2015-04-29 10:25:35","modified":"2015-04-29 10:25:35"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"5246","content_id":"837","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"5240","content_id":"837","tag_id":"108","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"108","code":"energy","name":"Energy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:45","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:45"}},{"id":"5241","content_id":"837","tag_id":"16","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"5242","content_id":"837","tag_id":"187","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"187","code":"transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership","name":"transatlantic trade and investment partnership","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"5243","content_id":"837","tag_id":"186","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"186","code":"ttip","name":"ttip","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"5244","content_id":"837","tag_id":"2","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"2","code":"laboratory","name":"Laboratory","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:04:01","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:01"}},{"id":"5245","content_id":"837","tag_id":"6","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"6","code":"globalisation","name":"Globalisation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:03:52","modified":"2013-09-27 10:03:52"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"5246","content_id":"837","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"763","code":"webinar-ttip-and-the-wider-atlantic-1","user_id":"1","title":"WEBINAR: TTIP AND THE WIDER ATLANTIC ","abstract":"<p>The first Atlantic Future webinar explored&nbsp;the potential impact of the TTIP on the four shores of the wider Atlantic Space.<\/p>","body":"<p>The first Atlantic Future webinar on &ldquo;TTIP and the Wider Atlantic&rdquo; took place on 15 April.

In these positions, he works to advance the values and institutions of open society in the cities and countries of the European Union and the Western Balkans. Vaquer writes and provides commentary for Spanish media, and often speaks at international debates and seminars on international affairs and EU politics.

Why should we think about the Atlantic in those terms?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A:&nbsp; The research focus of the Atlantic Future project is not self-evident. The Atlantic is an ocean, not an integrated region in any re&shy;cognizable shape; and it is not where the fo&shy;cus of international relations is, by contrast with the Arctic, the Indian Ocean and, above all, the Pacific. And yet, the space where Afri&shy;ca, the Americas and Europe meet remains one of crucial importance for Global Gover&shy;nance. The Atlantic perhaps exemplifies North\/South dynamics better than any other macro-region. It contains many of the difficulties and challenges of Global Governance; but, to address them, it can build on historical, cultural, linguistic and ideological links that cannot be compa&shy;red to those in any other Ocean basin. The weight of its past is an obstacle, but can also serve as a launching pad for future cooperation. And all Atlantic powers (from the US, the EU and Brazil, to the small littoral states of West Africa and the Caribbean) have an interest in not seeing the Atlantic become a backwater of global trade, and in maximizing the hitherto overlooked potential of their Atlantic links. These are all good reasons to take a serious, in depth look at the Atlantic space as an interlinked whole.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;To think about an Atlantic space is neither an exercise in wishful thinking, nor a nor&shy;mative endeavour. Atlantic Future as an intellectual project is an invi&shy;tation to lateral thinking and unusual re&shy;search, to take the less beaten track and ask the unexpected questions, to highlight the almost invisible connections and interpret the emerging trends. The research is teaching us about the four continents that border it, and about their links; at the same time, we are learning about Globalization, and the results may point towards possible roads to better global governance.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Which do you consider to be the trends that could shape the emergence of an Atlantic Space?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: The global redistribution of power affects the Atlantic space as much as any other part of the World. The emergence of the South holds the promise of a radical re-equilibrium for the whole Atlantic, with new opportunities for growth and exchange in all directions and, potentially, plenty of space for win-win situations. The pivot of the gravity centre of global geoeconomics towards Asia, on the contrary, represents a challenge to a space that was, for a long time, at the centre of Globalisation. Another trend is the emergence of new forms of regionalism in Africa and Latin America, less shaped by the EU model, and in a context where countries are rapidly abandoning old, post-colonial dependency relationships and developing multi-vector strategies (towards North America and Europe, but also towards East Asia, South Asia, inside the regions themselves, and across the southern Atlantic).<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Which areas for potential regional cooperation do you envisage for the Atlantic?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: &nbsp;The three areas with most potential for cooperation that I see are security, food production and environmental governance. In the area of security, the Atlantic space has a number of grey spaces &ndash; whether it is fragile states like Haiti and Guinea Bissau, weak states like Mauritania and Honduras that struggle to control violent groups, or even black holes of insecurity inside relatively large and powerful countries such as Mexico and Nigeria &ndash; where different kinds of mostly unconventional security risks (terrorism, drug traffic, violent crime and piracy) flourish. In food production, the Atlantic regions combined (the Americas, Africa and Europe) hold the key to addressing food security at global scale, but they have to find the ways to do it without intolerable ecologic impact. Finally, environmental governance is an urgent issue that cannot be delayed. From the preservation of fisheries to climate change, from biodiversity to chemical pollution of the oceans, the Atlantic could pioneer the solutions to a range of environmental issues.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"154","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"1","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-03-13 12:12:00","modified":"2016-02-07 19:01:30"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"116","content_id":"481","type":"1","file_name":"481-ATLANTIC VOICES_01.pdf","description":"Atlantic Voices.

Entitled&nbsp;&ldquo;The Atlantic: Drivers of Change&rdquo;, the event took place within a three-year collaborative research project funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme, entitled &ldquo;Towards an Atlantic area? Mapping trends, perspectives and interregional dynamics between Europe, Africa and the Americas.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>","body":"<p>The discussion kicked&nbsp;off with short presentations on new research findings which analyzed&nbsp;the changes occurring in the Atlantic basin with respect to energy, maritime security, and economic governance. It was argued that there is a high degree of fragmentation within the Atlantic space due to the&nbsp;growing importance of new actors and agendas. While opportunities and challenges exist when it comes to regional cooperation, there was a general consensus that there is a need for integrated&nbsp;policy strategies.<\/p>\r\n<p>Countries along the Atlantic basin have strong bases for&nbsp;cooperation -&nbsp;including language, democratic institutions, and cultural proximity -&nbsp;which are all driving factors for cooperation in the Atlantic. It was noted that a new era of energy may be found in the pan-Atlantic space, as it has the potential to drive the future of energy with its large capacity vis-&agrave;-vis renewable energy. With the expansion of new energy infrastructures in the pan-Atlantic space, this could also lead to market development as it has already caught the attention of Chinese and Indian investments.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>On maritime security, the discussion highlighted key&nbsp;threats; drug trafficking, organised crime, and piracy, all of&nbsp;which are becoming increasingly interlinked. Governments in both the South and the&nbsp;North see these threats as obstacles for cooperation but have not been able to adequately address the threat, which also carries economic costs for surrounding countries. Therefore,&nbsp;importance of cooperation to cope with maritime security issues was stressed.<\/p>\r\n<p>The discussion concluded with a discussion on the impact of the pending Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which was seen as vital in &nbsp;respect to the way the world is developing. Concerns were also raised about Europe and the U.S. becoming global economic leaders and to what degree they would provide a regulatory framework for others to follow &ndash; or whether some countries may be excluded.<\/p>\r\n<p><a

During his intervention the Admiral mentioned that Brazil has a lack of sources of power which makes necessary to prioritize the strategic way to withstand to traditional and non-traditional threats (maritime crime, rivalry of resources, etc.) that have an impact on the Atlantic sea. According to him, the international security context in which the Atlantic interconnections are developing have induced the Brazilian Navy to think and act in terms of dissuasion by denial or punishment as a way to face the conventional or non-conventional threats that makes the Atlantic Sea a strategically area for the country. Up to the point that the Brazilian Navy has decided to invest in the construction of the Nuclear Submarine for the Brazilian Navy.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Admiral's presentation was followed by three sessions dedicated to the analysis of the &ldquo;the global security order and its impact on the Atlantic regional dynamics&rdquo;, &ldquo;the view of the Atlantic Basin as a security area&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Atlantic security as a path to development&rdquo;. These sessions counted with the participation of different partners of the project and some of them were chaired by special invitees such as the Brazilian Captain Alves de Almeida and Victor Borges (member of the Atlantic Future Scientific Panel). Finally, the seminar closed with a roundtable where participants shared views about how the Atlantic has been changing in terms of past alliances and future prospects for the region.<\/p>\r\n<p>Check photos of the Second Plenary Meeting below:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422438518.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422438592.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 21.9200000762939px;\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422438893.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422438963.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422439389.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422439991.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 21.9200000762939px;\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422440031.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">Watch the morning sessions:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-video-container\"><span class=\"pusher\">.<\/span><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yQh10rCpMno?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">Watch the afternoon sessions:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-video-container\"><span class=\"pusher\">.<\/span><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/C6YuC9Exww0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><span class=\"pusher\" style=\"display: inline !important;\">Download the Plenary Meeting&nbsp;report here:<\/span><\/p>","views":"289","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-01-28 10:45:00","modified":"2016-02-08 08:40:18"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"106","content_id":"450","type":"1","file_name":"450-Atlantic Future Project.

It aims to examine perception of governmental policy-openness, likely timescales for policy implementation and perceived attitudes towards potential environmental harm. By mapping out the views of people who work closely with sustainability issues in Atlantic Basin countries, we consider that it is possible to gauge how favourable - as regards principle - and\/or cautious - as regards&nbsp;implementation &ndash; Basin countries are to environmental policy options. Environmental concerns are likely to increase in the future and those who have not had the forethought to invest in sustainability will be faced with ever smaller margins of flexibility. Depending upon how intensively and collectively - or not - sustainability policies are implemented, relations between Atlantic Basin countries will gradually become either conflictual or synergistic. From the GPI&nbsp;we intend to determine the potential roadblocks and points of contention that ought to be considered in the drawing board phase of green policy planning for the Atlantic Basin as a whole. It ought to be noted, however, that although we are working with the hypothesis that the polling of SD experts on sustainable policies will yield useful material, this research should be viewed as a pilot investigation into the desirability of producing the GPI on a more regular basis.&nbsp;In short, we aim to discover whether it is possible to collect and present useful information on green policy by polling SD experts, and, if so, whether various stakeholders would support the development and\/or deployment of an annual survey to capture the full spectrum of green policy perception.<\/p>","views":"361","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 15:09:00","modified":"2016-01-31 09:41:31"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"97","content_id":"339","type":"1","file_name":"339-ATLANTIC FUTURE_18_Sustainable Policy Perceptions in the Atlantic Basin.compressed.pdf","description":"Sustainable Policy Perceptions in the Atlantic Basin","created":"2014-12-05 14:26:04","modified":"2014-12-05 14:26:04"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4246","content_id":"339","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"4241","content_id":"339","tag_id":"43","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"43","code":"policy","name":"Policy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:04:43","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:43"}},{"id":"4242","content_id":"339","tag_id":"109","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"109","code":"environment","name":"Environment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:06:53","modified":"2013-09-27 11:06:53"}},{"id":"4243","content_id":"339","tag_id":"167","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"167","code":"fundacao-getulio-vargas-fgv-rio-de-janeiro","name":"funda\u00e7ao get\u00falio vargas (fgv) rio de janeiro","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4244","content_id":"339","tag_id":"168","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"168","code":"-brazil","name":" brazil","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4245","content_id":"339","tag_id":"150","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4246","content_id":"339","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"338","code":"an-atlantic-energy-renaissance","user_id":"1","title":"An Atlantic energy renaissance","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 17 is out: \"<\/strong><strong>Atlantic Energy and the Changing Global Energy Flow Map<\/strong><strong>\", by <\/strong><strong>Paul Isbell<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>at&nbsp;<\/strong><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/transatlantic.sais-jhu.edu\/\">CTR<\/a>&nbsp;<\/strong>(<strong>Center for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies)<\/strong><\/p>","body":"<p>An &lsquo;Atlantic energy renaissance&rsquo; is currently unfolding across the &lsquo;Atlantic Basin,&rsquo; where roughly half of the world&rsquo;s known fossil fuels are located and more than two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s renewable energy is currently generated. The technological revolutions in &lsquo;unconventional&rsquo; and &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; hydrocarbons &ndash; in shale and offshore &ndash; have recently contributed to a shift in the global center of gravity of energy supply away from the &lsquo;Great Crescent&rsquo; and into the &lsquo;Atlantic Basin.&rsquo; Combined with the shift in the global center of gravity for demand to emerging Asia-Pacific, these &lsquo;revolutions&rsquo; are reversing the traditional &lsquo;westward&rsquo; flow of energy from Eurasia to the Atlantic to produce a new pattern of global flows in which the countries of the Atlantic Basin will increasingly become the net suppliers of energy at the margin to Asia-Pacific. Furthermore, such &lsquo;revolutions&rsquo; have also played a role in the recent reversal of fortunes of renewable energy, particularly in the Northern Atlantic. Therefore, while shifting energy flow map &ndash; largely driven by the Atlantic energy renaissance &ndash; both calls into question the notion of the &lsquo;Asian century&rsquo; and problematizes the rationale behind the US &lsquo;pivot to Asia,&rsquo; it also reveals new geopolitical and governance potential along the strategic horizon for Atlantic actors. However, such potential&nbsp;will remain unrealized without &lsquo;pan-Atlantic energy cooperation that addresses both the emerging issues of the new &lsquo;energy seascape&rsquo; and the low carbon &lsquo;imperative.&rsquo; Finally, the &lsquo;Atlantic energy renaissance&rsquo; and the changing global energy flow map of which it is both cause and effect, also highlights the growing relative strategic significance of the &lsquo;Southern Atlantic&rsquo;.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"1090","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 15:06:00","modified":"2016-02-08 16:04:31"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"77","content_id":"338","type":"1","file_name":"338-ATLANTIC FUTURE_17_Energy.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 17: \u201cAtlantic Energy and the Changing Global Energy Flow Map\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 15:08:02","modified":"2014-09-29 15:08:02"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4101","content_id":"338","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"4094","content_id":"338","tag_id":"108","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"108","code":"energy","name":"Energy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:45","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:45"}},{"id":"4095","content_id":"338","tag_id":"162","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"162","code":"resources","name":"resources","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4096","content_id":"338","tag_id":"1","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"1","code":"atlantic-basin","name":"Atlantic Basin","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:54:32","modified":"2013-09-27 09:54:32"}},{"id":"4097","content_id":"338","tag_id":"126","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"126","code":"cooperation","name":"Cooperation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:21:56","modified":"2013-09-30 10:21:56"}},{"id":"4098","content_id":"338","tag_id":"125","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"125","code":"johns-hopkins-university-jhu","name":"Johns Hopkins University (JHU)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:19:12","modified":"2013-09-30 10:19:12"}},{"id":"4099","content_id":"338","tag_id":"15","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"4100","content_id":"338","tag_id":"150","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4101","content_id":"338","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"337","code":"climate-change-impacts-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Climate change impacts in the Atlantic","abstract":"<blockquote><strong>[Photo Credit: Reuters File Photo]<\/strong><\/blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 16 is out: \"<\/strong><strong>Climate change impacts in the Atlantic Basin and coordinated adaptation responses<\/strong><strong>\", by <\/strong><strong>Christoph Stefes, Andrew Reid, Lucy Smith, and Elizabeth Tedsen<\/strong><strong> at&nbsp;<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ecologic.eu\/\">Ecologic Institute<\/a><\/p>","body":"<p>The need for ambitious implementation of strategies and measures for climate adaptation has become clear, however, at a global level, it is uncertain if or whether the issue is best confronted by centralised or fragmented structures of adaptation governance. This paper, an output of the EU ATLANTIC FUTURE project, investigates the dynamic network of transnational climate adaptation institutions currently working in the Atlantic Basin region. From a broad pool of adaptation institutions present in the Atlantic, eight case studies were selected and investigated, together representing an array of regions, forms of cooperation, actors, and thematic issues. Through case study analysis, this paper considers whether the work undertaken by these institutions is uniquely &lsquo;Atlantic&rsquo; in nature &ndash; that is, if and how they are driven, facilitated, or bounded by the specific actors, climate impacts, or characteristics of the region &ndash; or whether they are more global in nature. Secondly, we examine how these institutions fit within the larger picture of fragmented global climate adaptation governance. In doing so, we find indications that the Atlantic hosts and fosters a diverse and active array of institutions, but that these are largely focused on the production and exchange of scientific knowledge and capacity building, rather than on the implementation of concrete measures. Although the fragmented governance structure currently in place has produced much valuable work, increased centralisation could be beneficial for ensuring better coordination and implementation of adaptation activities at the ground level.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"630","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 15:03:00","modified":"2016-02-07 05:16:14"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"76","content_id":"337","type":"1","file_name":"337-ATLANTIC FUTURE_16_Climate change impacts in the Atlantic Basin.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 16: \u201cClimate change impacts in the Atlantic Basin and coordinated adaptation responses\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 15:03:30","modified":"2014-09-29 15:03:30"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4398","content_id":"337","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"4393","content_id":"337","tag_id":"107","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"107","code":"climate-change","name":"Climate change","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:29","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:29"}},{"id":"4394","content_id":"337","tag_id":"88","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"88","code":"governance","name":"Governance","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:55:35","modified":"2013-09-27 10:55:35"}},{"id":"4395","content_id":"337","tag_id":"109","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"109","code":"environment","name":"Environment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:06:53","modified":"2013-09-27 11:06:53"}},{"id":"4396","content_id":"337","tag_id":"124","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"124","code":"ecologic-institute-gmbh-ecologic","name":"Ecologic Institute GmbH (ECOLOGIC)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-02 14:28:09","modified":"2013-12-02 14:28:09"}},{"id":"4397","content_id":"337","tag_id":"150","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4398","content_id":"337","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"336","code":"marine-resources-and-coastal-livelihoods","user_id":"1","title":"Marine resources and coastal livelihoods","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 15 is out: \"Marine resource management and coastal livelihoods: an Atlantic perspective\", by Elizabeth Tedsen, Benjamin Boteler, Katriona McGlade, Tanja&nbsp;Srebotnjak, and Katrina Abhold at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ecologic.eu\/\">Ecologic Institute<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","body":"<p>Marine ecosystem resources play important roles in coastal countries, providing numerous benefits and services.

This organization was built on the shared history and language of its eight member states &ndash; Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao&nbsp;Tome and Principe and Timor-Leste &ndash; and has recently attracted the interest of many states in and out of the Atlantic Basin. In this context, language is one of the assets allowing this organization to increase its international projection and attractiveness. Notwithstanding, it is also true that recent power configurations in the South Atlantic &ndash; with energy and security matters&nbsp;at its core &ndash; has also contributed to increasing the CPLP&rsquo;s &lsquo;magnetism&rsquo;. Hence, we argue that language has allowed the CPLP to project soft power (through the pivotal role played by the governments of Portugal and Brazil), but that language itself has in turn benefited from the economic attractiveness of the organization. Many states in and out of the Atlantic Basin now perceive the CPLP as a relevant forum through which they can reach the &lsquo;Lusophone world&rsquo;. In as much as entering the CPLP requires compliance with certain political values and the adoption of the Portuguese language (or of policies that promote its diffusion) there is a new opportunity to increase language potential.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"312","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 14:04:00","modified":"2016-02-06 14:15:22"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"74","content_id":"332","type":"1","file_name":"332-ATLANTIC FUTURE_14_The community of Portuguese Language Speaking Countries.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 14: \u201cThe community of Portuguese Language Speaking Countries\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 14:05:06","modified":"2014-09-29 14:05:06"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4428","content_id":"332","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},{"id":"4422","content_id":"332","tag_id":"15","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"4423","content_id":"332","tag_id":"195","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"195","code":"brazil","name":"brazil","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4424","content_id":"332","tag_id":"229","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"229","code":"language","name":"language","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4425","content_id":"332","tag_id":"228","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"228","code":"portuguese","name":"portuguese","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4426","content_id":"332","tag_id":"152","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"152","code":"instituto-portugues-de-relaces-internacionais-ipri","name":"Instituto Portugu\u00eas de Rela\u00e7\u00f5es Internacionais (IPRI)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-10 14:59:43","modified":"2013-12-10 14:59:43"}},{"id":"4427","content_id":"332","tag_id":"150","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4428","content_id":"332","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"331","code":"human-mobility-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Human mobility in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 13 is out: \"<\/strong><strong>Geometries of Human Mobility in the Atlantic Space<\/strong><strong>\", by <\/strong><strong>Camila Pastor de Mar&iacute;a Campos<\/strong><strong> at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cide.edu\/\">CIDE<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","body":"<p>This paper is concerned with tracking trends in international migration within the Atlantic basin between 1990 and 2013 and the historical patterns characterizing Atlantic mobility on which these two decades build.

For example, historical trajectories and political context are absent from the analyses. Policy driven databases produced by various agencies of international governance afford a vast yet superficial grasp of global mobility patterns, which can be complemented and complicated through smaller scale and longitudinal projects that provide qualitative depth to our understanding of human mobility. Human movement is crucially structured by economic differentials and opportunity, but also by shared colonial histories that sowed specific linguistic skills and social aspirations as they unified political boundaries.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"369","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 14:02:00","modified":"2016-02-08 11:10:54"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"73","content_id":"331","type":"1","file_name":"331-ATLANTIC FUTURE_13_Geometries of Human Mobility in the Atlantic Space.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 13: \u201cGeometries of Human Mobility in the Atlantic Space\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 14:02:53","modified":"2014-09-29 14:02:53"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4127","content_id":"331","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},{"id":"4123","content_id":"331","tag_id":"94","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"94","code":"migration","name":"Migration","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:57:01","modified":"2013-09-27 10:57:01"}},{"id":"4124","content_id":"331","tag_id":"227","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"227","code":"mobility","name":"mobility","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4125","content_id":"331","tag_id":"153","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

Development cooperation is indicative of broader shifts in political, economic, and cultural clout and key elements of the global aid architecture are adapting a new reality. In light of South-South Cooperation&rsquo;s emergence as an alternative to traditional aid, the analysis of cooperation in the Atlantic Basin points to an increasingly diverse global South. The diversity, in turn could position the Atlantic as a laboratory for innovative approaches to development cooperation. In the foreseeable future, interaction among Atlantic development partners, whether through cooperation, coordination, or competition, is unlikely to be crystalized into a new institutional set-up but will rather become the sum of dynamic and flexible arrangements reflecting the diversity of actors, interests, and strategies.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"454","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 13:56:00","modified":"2016-02-08 14:09:44"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"71","content_id":"329","type":"1","file_name":"329-ATLANTIC FUTURE_11_Development in the Atlantic.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 11: \u201cDevelopment in the Atlantic: Between cooperation and competition\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 13:57:14","modified":"2014-09-29 13:57:14"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4138","content_id":"329","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},{"id":"4134","content_id":"329","tag_id":"126","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"126","code":"cooperation","name":"Cooperation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:21:56","modified":"2013-09-30 10:21:56"}},{"id":"4135","content_id":"329","tag_id":"15","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"4136","content_id":"329","tag_id":"157","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"157","code":"german-marshall-fund","name":"german marshall fund","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4137","content_id":"329","tag_id":"150","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4138","content_id":"329","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"328","code":"ideas--norms-and-principles-","user_id":"1","title":"Ideas, Norms and Principles ","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 10 is out: \"Convergence or Divergence of Ideas, Norms, and Principles in the Atlantic?

In other words whether the idea of a &lsquo;pan-Atlantic area&rsquo; is a viable political, social, and cultural concept. More specifically, it explores whether or not the Atlantic space can be characterized as an area of normative convergence. To do so the paper employs insights from the literatures on policy convergence and policy transfer and in particular the &lsquo;soft&rsquo; transfer of policy inputs through transnational networks. Rather than attempt to map the intangible transfer of ideas, norms, and principles across the Atlantic space, the approach taken here is to map the structures through which soft transfer can potentially take place. An analysis of online survey&nbsp;data from 150 environmental NGOs based in Europe, Africa and the Americas reveals a concentration of transnational networks within the Atlantic space, which could potentially contribute to the convergence of ideas, norms, and principles in the area. In this way, the paper argues that the pattern of transnational networks observed provides some supporting evidence of the emergence of an Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"201","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 13:54:00","modified":"2016-01-31 12:55:00"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"70","content_id":"328","type":"1","file_name":"328-ATLANTIC FUTURE_10_Convergence or Divergence of Ideas Norms and Principles.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 10: \"Convergence or Divergence of Ideas, Norms, and Principles in the Atlantic?

The geopolitical reality of the Atlantic basin is however far more complex. It extends beyond the Atlantic regions and develops in parallel tracks of competition and cooperation along North-South and South-South asymmetries and convergence. Shared interest and concerns over the impact of fragility and in specific fragile contexts provide an opportunity to test whether and how Atlantic diversity can generate new momentum and more effective approaches to address fragility in the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"342","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"1","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 12:47:00","modified":"2016-02-06 20:02:55"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"92","content_id":"327","type":"1","file_name":"327-ATLANTIC FUTURE_09_Fragiles states.compressed.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 9: \"Fragile States: Challenges and Opportunities for Atlantic Relations\"","created":"2014-10-09 10:17:26","modified":"2014-10-09 10:17:26"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4216","content_id":"327","tag_id":"21","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},{"id":"4211","content_id":"327","tag_id":"130","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"130","code":"human-security","name":"Human security","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-10 11:59:29","modified":"2013-10-10 11:59:29"}},{"id":"4212","content_id":"327","tag_id":"15","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"4213","content_id":"327","tag_id":"140","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"4214","content_id":"327","tag_id":"157","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"157","code":"german-marshall-fund","name":"german marshall fund","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4215","content_id":"327","tag_id":"150","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4216","content_id":"327","tag_id":"21","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"326","code":"transnational-threats-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Transnational threats in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 8 is out: \"Significant Trends in Illicit Trafficking: A Macro View of the Problem and Potential Means to Address It\", by Dr. Mark R.

Far from being homogeneous, the Atlantic Basin combines different historical and cultural backgrounds, diverse natural features, and distinct levels of development. While these favour numerous&nbsp;economic and political opportunities, they may represent an obstacle in tackling maritime security issues. Through the present study, maritime border disputes are identified and mapped, and a further analysis about its impacts on interstate relations is developed. We conclude that, although there are obstacles fostering cooperation on maritime security, such cooperation is becoming increasingly relevant to the North and South Atlantic in terms of management of territorial disputes, impacts of climate change, resource protection, regulation of the maritime system and prevention of international crime.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"258","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 12:42:00","modified":"2016-02-01 16:23:29"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"67","content_id":"325","type":"1","file_name":"325-ATLANTIC FUTURE_07_Maritime Security in the Atlantic.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 7: \"Maritime Territorial Delimitation and Maritime Security in the Atlantic\"","created":"2014-09-29 12:43:46","modified":"2014-09-29 12:43:46"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4167","content_id":"325","tag_id":"21","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},{"id":"4163","content_id":"325","tag_id":"167","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"167","code":"fundacao-getulio-vargas-fgv-rio-de-janeiro","name":"funda\u00e7ao get\u00falio vargas (fgv) rio de janeiro","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4164","content_id":"325","tag_id":"168","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"168","code":"-brazil","name":" brazil","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4165","content_id":"325","tag_id":"208","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"208","code":"maritime-security","name":"maritime security","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4166","content_id":"325","tag_id":"150","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4167","content_id":"325","tag_id":"21","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"324","code":"the-atlantic-as-a-new-security-area","user_id":"1","title":"The Atlantic as a new security area?","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 6 is out: \"The Atlantic as a new security area?

It does this by examining the factors that have led to growth in the past and examines the current network of transport links; in particular maritime networks. The paper outlines demand and supply based drivers. It finds on the demand side that the growth of national GDP&rsquo;s has led not only to an increase in goods transported but also to a change in the composition of those goods. Growing GDP has also influenced the mode of transport used to&nbsp;carry goods. Other demand side factors that have influenced the growth of trade include lower trade barriers as a result of trade agreements; the entry into the world economy of former centrally planned command economies as well as the emerging BRICS and NICs and the operations of multinational companies. On the supply side the main influence in promoting networks include the decline in transportation costs brought about by technological changes affecting ships and aircraft coupled with the increase in investment in sea ports and airports as well as the associated development of hub and spoke networks. The development and use of the internet connections has also boosted trade in goods. To regenerate the Atlantic economy will require inter-governmental cooperation to develop economic and political institutions to facilitate economic integration and growth and improve transport networks in the Atlantic economic space.<\/p>","views":"185","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-23 12:54:00","modified":"2016-02-06 02:13:49"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"65","content_id":"311","type":"1","file_name":"311-ATLANTIC FUTURE_05_Technology, Trade and Changes in Transport in the.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 5: \"Technology, Trade and Changes in Transport in the Atlantic Space\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:55:27","modified":"2014-09-23 12:55:27"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"7296","content_id":"311","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"7292","content_id":"311","tag_id":"78","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"78","code":"transport","name":"Transport","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:52:35","modified":"2013-09-27 10:52:35"}},{"id":"7293","content_id":"311","tag_id":"161","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"161","code":"maritime-transport","name":"maritime transport","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7294","content_id":"311","tag_id":"16","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"7295","content_id":"311","tag_id":"150","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"7296","content_id":"311","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"310","code":"global-value-chains-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Global Value Chains in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 4 is out: \"Global Value Chains in the Atlantic Space\", by Mariana Magaldi de Sousa and Elsy Gonzalez Cubr&iacute;a at<\/strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cide.edu\/\"><strong>CIDE<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","body":"<p>Global value chains (GVCs) have revolutionized trade. Countries no longer have to produce a particular product from scratch; all they must do is insert themselves into an existing chain of production that often spreads across several countries. Nevertheless, insertion into a global value chain has become a real challenge. Economies that are not able to successfully insert&nbsp;themselves into multiple GVCs are likely to reduce their opportunities for industrialization and economic growth. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which countries in the Atlantic Space have inserted themselves into GVCs in the past two decades. It draws on an original dataset of trade patterns by stage of production and value added that spans from 1995 to 2012, collected from the UN COMTRADE databank and the OECD-WTO Trade in Value Added (TiVA) dataset. It finds that despite some interesting cross-country variation, participation in GVCs is still generally low. The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we review the concept of value chain participation and alternative methodologies for measuring it. Section 3 provides a panoramic view of trade flows in the Atlantic, and Section 4 focuses on empirical evidence of GVC participation in two case studies (Mexico and Brazil). Section 5 briefly assesses the available information on trade in value added in selected countries of the Atlantic space and the last Section concludes.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"344","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-23 12:50:00","modified":"2016-02-05 16:19:15"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"64","content_id":"310","type":"1","file_name":"310-ATLANTIC FUTURE_04_Global Value Chains in the Atlantic Space.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 4: \"Global value chains in the Atlantic Space\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:50:39","modified":"2014-09-23 12:50:39"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4182","content_id":"310","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"4179","content_id":"310","tag_id":"16","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"4180","content_id":"310","tag_id":"153","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

Two main research questions are posed: Can Atlantic Space agreements connect the bilateral and multilateral trade frameworks and contribute to a new framework on global trade governance? What are the areas of convergence and divergence between RTAs negotiated in the Atlantic Space and the WTO Agreements? Findings reveal that: firstly, trade liberalisation commitments undertaken with in the Atlantic Space by partner countries are driven by the aim of achieving convergence on trade rules between RTAs with WTO Agreements. Some agreements are, however, aspirational in nature. Second, the degree of trade governance convergence between Atlantic space trading arrangements and the WTO Agreements depends on the level of partner countries&rsquo; development and their integration into the world economy, suggesting that RTAs with countries that are well integrated into the world economy tend to exhibit greater convergence to WTO Agreements. However, there is a clear trend of an overlap between RTAs and WTO Agreements which can be interpreted to mean that regional agreements could support the Atlantic Space&rsquo;s role as a global actor to shape a functioning multilateral order.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"249","shares":"1","tweets":"4","mails":"1","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-23 12:44:00","modified":"2016-02-06 03:24:44"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"63","content_id":"309","type":"1","file_name":"309-ATLANTIC FUTURE_03_Multilateral Agreements and Global Governance of International Trade Regimes.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 3: \"Multilateral Agreements and Global Governance of International Trade Regimes\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:45:22","modified":"2014-09-23 12:45:22"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4190","content_id":"309","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"4187","content_id":"309","tag_id":"88","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"88","code":"governance","name":"Governance","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:55:35","modified":"2013-09-27 10:55:35"}},{"id":"4188","content_id":"309","tag_id":"165","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"165","code":"aberystwyth-university-wales-uk","name":"Aberystwyth University Wales (UK)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-01-15 10:50:33","modified":"2014-01-15 10:50:33"}},{"id":"4189","content_id":"309","tag_id":"150","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4190","content_id":"309","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"308","code":"commercial-ties-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Commercial ties in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 2 is out: \"<\/strong><strong>Commercial Ties in the Atlantic Basin: The Evolving Role of Services and Investment<\/strong><strong>\", by Daniel S.

Services are the sleeping giant of the pan-Atlantic economy. The Atlantic is home to the world's major services economies; Atlantic economies are each other's most important services markets; and Atlantic economies are poised to be major beneficiaries and drivers of the growth in global services. Services are not just a North Atlantic story; they represent a growing area of commercial activity among Southern Atlantic countries as well, particularly in energy related services; engineering and construction services; and education and managerial services. The United States and Europe are global leaders as outward investors and recipients. But today a rising global share of FDI emanates from the developing nations. And whereas trade and investment ties, and bank lending, between these nations and Africa and South and Central America were once shallow and underdeveloped, such linkages are now thicker, more robust and more sophisticated, particularly from China. But the EU remains the largest source of FDI on all Atlantic continents. It is also the largest holder of portfolio assets in North America. Its assets in Africa are roughly equal to those of Asia. North America accounted for over half of South and Central America's portfolio holdings in 2012, with the EU the only other major asset holder. South and Central America's holdings in North America and Europe grew rapidly over the past decade, although from a low base. All told, the Atlantic Hemisphere accounted for 83.8% of EU portfolio assets and 70.2% of North American portfolio assets in 2012.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"253","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-23 12:27:00","modified":"2016-02-03 21:19:29"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"61","content_id":"308","type":"1","file_name":"308-ATLANTIC FUTURE_02_Commercial ties in the Atlantic Basin.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 2: \"Commercial Ties in the Atlantic Basin:\r\nThe Evolving Role of Services and Investment\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:28:39","modified":"2014-09-23 12:28:39"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4195","content_id":"308","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"4191","content_id":"308","tag_id":"16","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"4192","content_id":"308","tag_id":"160","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"160","code":"investment","name":"investment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4193","content_id":"308","tag_id":"125","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"125","code":"johns-hopkins-university-jhu","name":"Johns Hopkins University (JHU)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:19:12","modified":"2013-09-30 10:19:12"}},{"id":"4194","content_id":"308","tag_id":"150","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4195","content_id":"308","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"305","code":"direct-investment-flows-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Direct investment flows in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 1 is out: \"Continuities and changes in patterns of direct investment flows between South America and Africa\", by Katarina Pereira da Costa at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cesem.ma\/\">HEM-CESEM<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>","body":"<p>The countries of Africa and South America have been experiencing in the last years a substantial growth in their direct investment flows, deepening their integration into the international economy. Recently, we notice the emergence of new partners, who gained weight in Africa and South America direct investments flows, to the detriment of their traditional partners &ndash; the European Union (EU) and the United States (US). Both Africa and South America are diversifying their direct investments towards emerging countries, which includes deepening their own bilateral relationship. The main objective of this paper is to present a general analysis of direct investment relations between South America and Africa, and its relations with the world as well as with the two other important actors in the Atlantic space, the US and the EU. The paper also presents an analysis of Brazilian direct investments in Africa as well as a brief review of South African investments in Brazil.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"231","shares":"1","tweets":"3","mails":"2","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-22 17:02:00","modified":"2016-02-02 17:02:29"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"62","content_id":"305","type":"1","file_name":"305-ATLANTIC FUTURE_01_Continuities and changes in patterns of direct investment flows between South America and Africa.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 1: \"Continuities and changes in patterns of direct investment flows between South America and Africa\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:30:16","modified":"2014-09-23 12:30:16"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4204","content_id":"305","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"4196","content_id":"305","tag_id":"179","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"179","code":"south-africa","name":"South Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:53:06","modified":"2014-04-24 14:53:06"}},{"id":"4197","content_id":"305","tag_id":"140","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"4198","content_id":"305","tag_id":"141","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"141","code":"latin-america","name":"Latin America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:43","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:43"}},{"id":"4199","content_id":"305","tag_id":"149","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"149","code":"institut-des-hautes-etudes-de-management-hem","name":"Institut des Hautes Etudes de Management (HEM)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-02 14:34:30","modified":"2013-12-02 14:34:30"}},{"id":"4200","content_id":"305","tag_id":"68","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"68","code":"foreign-direct-investment","name":"Foreign direct investment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:49:59","modified":"2013-09-27 10:49:59"}},{"id":"4201","content_id":"305","tag_id":"160","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"160","code":"investment","name":"investment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4202","content_id":"305","tag_id":"194","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"194","code":"direct-investment-flows","name":"direct investment flows","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4203","content_id":"305","tag_id":"150","order":"8","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4204","content_id":"305","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"199","code":"an-atlantic-lunch-with-up-students","user_id":"1","title":"An Atlantic lunch with UP students","abstract":"<p style=\"margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 18.75pt; margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 16.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans','sans-serif'; color: #4c4c4c;\">The ATLANTIC FUTURE workshop in Pretoria was organized by GovInn (Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation), University of Pretoria, in June 2014.

Thirty six prominent students or &lsquo;UP Young Innovators&rsquo; were selected to participate. These were international postgraduate students from a variety of different disciplines from across the University, including political science, engineering and the natural sciences.<\/p>\r\n<p>During the working lunch, the students had the opportunity to discuss some of the key themes of the ATLANTIC FUTURE such as security, the environment, institutional cooperation and migration, among others, with Project&rsquo;s senior researchers R. Andreas Kraemer (Ecologic Institute), Camila Pastor (CIDE), In&ecirc;s Sousa (FGV), and Madeleine Goerg (GMF). Each table gathered around 8 to 10 prominent UP Young Innovators.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ATLANTIC FUTURE working lunch started with opening remarks by Jordi Vaquer (CIDOB), in which he presented the ATLANTIC FUTURE project in a global context. The discussions in each of the tables revolved around the following topics:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The table chaired by In&ecirc;s Catarina Pereira da Costa Sousa (FGV) focused on <strong>security in the Atlantic<\/strong>. Far from being homogeneous, the Atlantic Basin combines different historical and cultural backgrounds, diverse natural features, and distinct levels of development. While these favour numerous economic and political opportunities, they may represent an obstacle in tackling maritime security challenges. The maritime security in the Atlantic becomes strategically important to the North and South Atlantic in terms of resources, regulation of maritime system, prevention of international crime, territorial disputes, and control of terrorist activities. The redistribution and rebalancing of power occurring in the world drive the main stakeholders in the region to look at the Atlantic wider region as a potential space of cooperation. However, are the traditional Atlantic Basin powers (the US and the EU) willing to recognise these new actors? The lunchtime discussions addressed this and other related questions. For example, are Atlantic Basin countries willing to make the Atlantic a priority when formulating their foreign policies? Why is it relevant to look at the Atlantic wider structure as a potential source of maritime security cooperation for Africa? Can we identify common strategic security interests in the Atlantic Basin countries?<\/p>\r\n<p>The table chaired by Camila Pastor (CIDE) focused on <strong>migration in the Atlantic<\/strong>. The discussions mainly concerned international migration in the Atlantic basin between 1990 and 2013, as well as the historical patterns characterizing Atlantic mobility that these two decades build on. Current human mobility is reminiscent of the intense Atlantic mobility in the late nineteenth century but the patterns have changed significantly, as have the means of tracking migration, of regulating it, and of requesting migrants&rsquo; political and cultural commitment to their host countries. In addition, the discussions started with a brief overview of the history of the Atlantic basin as a social space structured by mobility and then also focused on global patterns and concerns around migration.<\/p>\r\n<p>The table chaired by Madeleine Goerg (GMF) focused on <strong>institutional cooperation in the Atlantic<\/strong>. The past decade has seen a broad rebalancing of power and a growing assertiveness of the global South. As hierarchies are redefined and interactions between states redrawn, the Atlantic basin brings the enduring dichotomy between North and South into perspective by pointing to nuanced and complex relations in the realm of institutional cooperation. This discussion sought to address some of the key dynamics in institutional cooperation in the Atlantic basin. It tackled questions such as: with the rise of countries like Brazil and South Africa, how have changing economic dynamics impacted existing forms cooperation? In which policy areas is cooperation most desirable and most effective and at which level? What institutional factors, facilitate or hinder cooperation, and what are the main sources of tension and factors for political cooperation in the current context?<\/p>\r\n<p>The table chaired by R. Andreas Kraemer (Ecologic Institute) focused on <strong>shared environmental issues in the Atlantic<\/strong>. R. Andreas Kraemer started the discussion by summarizing the Atlantic-specific, regional dynamics of global environmental challenges. He explained that the pan-Atlantic is not an abstract of international relations, but a biophysical reality. Beyond a shared physical environment, Atlantic Basin countries also share common histories and starting points. The table then attempted to address whether the interconnected Atlantic space helps to resolve, or instead worsen, shared environmental challenges. On the whole, it was thought that there is high potential for inter-Basin cooperation on resource management based on such similarities and on mutual challenges and interests.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Download the report here:<\/p>","views":"441","shares":"1","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-06-14 09:00:00","modified":"2016-02-08 08:10:58"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"59","content_id":"199","type":"1","file_name":"199-Working lunch with UP Young Innovators.pdf","description":"","created":"2014-06-13 13:03:25","modified":"2014-06-13 13:03:25"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"3196","content_id":"199","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"3187","content_id":"199","tag_id":"109","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"109","code":"environment","name":"Environment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:06:53","modified":"2013-09-27 11:06:53"}},{"id":"3188","content_id":"199","tag_id":"26","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"3189","content_id":"199","tag_id":"190","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"190","code":"r-andreas-kraemer","name":"r. andreas kraemer","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3190","content_id":"199","tag_id":"21","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},{"id":"3191","content_id":"199","tag_id":"126","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"126","code":"cooperation","name":"Cooperation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:21:56","modified":"2013-09-30 10:21:56"}},{"id":"3192","content_id":"199","tag_id":"94","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"94","code":"migration","name":"Migration","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:57:01","modified":"2013-09-27 10:57:01"}},{"id":"3193","content_id":"199","tag_id":"5","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"5","code":"atlantic-space","name":"Atlantic space","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:55:08","modified":"2013-09-27 09:55:08"}},{"id":"3194","content_id":"199","tag_id":"189","order":"8","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"189","code":"govinn","name":"govinn","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3195","content_id":"199","tag_id":"178","order":"9","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"178","code":"university-of-pretoria","name":"University of Pretoria","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:52:42","modified":"2014-04-24 14:52:42"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"3196","content_id":"199","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"198","code":"roundtable-atlantic-in-a-changing-world","user_id":"1","title":"Roundtable: Atlantic in a changing world","abstract":"<p style=\"margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 18.75pt; margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 16.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans','sans-serif'; color: #4c4c4c;\">The ATLANTIC FUTURE workshop in Pretoria was organized by GovInn (Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation), University of Pretoria, in June 2014.

One of the topics that drew more attention was the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) currently under negotiation between the EU and the US.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/198-1402656964.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The main ideas that emerged during the roundtable are summarized below.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Francis Kornegay<\/strong> talked of South Africa&rsquo;s role and its pivot position in the Southern sea lanes. In terms of geopolitics in the Atlantic, there exist major issues that need to be sorted out and, for that, there needs to be a North-South dialogue within the Atlantic. We need to look at different organizations, he said, that go beyond the North Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Sonia Lucarelli<\/strong> spoke of how transatlantic relations have been limited to the North-North relations consolidated during the Cold War. We are currently in the process of deconstructing the concept of transatlantic relations limited to the North, so that it includes a wider, broader, space. But this process of deconstruction is still very preliminary and it has important limitations: there are strong differences such as the North-South divide but also great differences within the South; there are differences in the intensity of relations among the regions, such as economic relations (even if South-South trade has increased, the figures cannot be compared), and others such as migration patterns with huge migrations within the regions. In addition, there are also huge asymmetries in the relations between regions.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite these weaknesses and limits, however, there is evidence of change in the Atlantic. The North-North line is strong, in spite of the economic crisis, the South-South is also gaining importance, and strategic relations are particularly important. There is need for more transatlantic cooperation, and enhanced dialogue is desperately needed, as there are common challenges that need to be handled together such as demographic trends or food scarcity.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>R. Andreas Kraemer&nbsp;<\/strong>wondered what will happen within the next years with Russia trying to bring back the Cold War dynamics and how will the Atlantic partnership react to that. He spoke of environmental and resources in the Atlantic. The Atlantic makes sense as a unit of analysis, he said, and although of course it is not a closed space, the Atlantic has its own internal dynamics. Regarding environment, R. Andreas Kraemer explained that the main actors in this arena are disruptive actors (the coal, gas, oil lobbies, etc.) and it does not appear to be a counterweight of pro-environmental actors. This asymmetry, he said, may lead to disaster. In particular, climate change will lead to disastrous consequences. He made another point referring to Brazil, an actor that keeps standing on the side and blocking any initiative. Brazil needs to engage, he affirmed.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Claudia S&aacute;nchez Bajo <\/strong>pointed that we are in a transition from thinking the Atlantic as a divided area, as a space of conquest, to thinking about it as a shared zone. There is an effort to make it a zone peace and free of nuclear weapons, which is a big difference with other oceans. For example, the South Atlantic was declared a &ldquo;Free-Zone&rdquo;, and that opened the way for multiple types of pacific cooperation. There is also a discourse of promoting democracy and human rights. Exchanges of values across the Atlantic have taken place. On another topic, she referred to the emergence of clusters of entrepreneurs from both sides, an interesting development that needs to be looked at.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Antonio Fiori<\/strong> referred to the pivot to Asia. From a Pacific perspective, he said, we need to look also from the other side and need to look at another pivot: the pivot of Asia into the Atlantic. The rise of the Pacific is influencing pan-Atlantic dynamics in a number of ways. Firstly, trade between Atlantic and non-Atlantic partners has boomed. China is one of the main actors here, one of the important trade partners in the Atlantic (it is present in Africa, in Latin America), and there are also other Asian partners such as South Korea or Malaysia. This, he pointed out, resembles traditional colonial patterns. For example, 90% of exports to China are commodities, and 90% of imported goods from China are manufactured goods. It is difficult not to think of becoming locked again in colonial-style relationships. Secondly, trade has also created new port facilities, in particular the Panama Canal, with China controlling the leases at both ends of the Canal. Thirdly, the melting ice in the Arctic is also crucial, as it is opening new routes of communication. It has shifted Atlantic and Pacific attention to the Arctic, and China is there. It is predicted that most of Chinese trade will be carried out through the Northern lines in the future.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Jordi Vaquer <\/strong>started his intervention by pointing that oceans divide and do not unite, except of course if one looks at the Ocean itself (in terms of ecological matters and other areas). He pointed at three other obvious aspects related to relations in the Atlantic. Firstly, there are at least two spaces: the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic; secondly, there are too many asymmetries between the North and the South; and thirdly, the Atlantic is not problematic enough so it does not attract attention, and there is no institutional framework of any meaning compared, for example, to APEC. So, he enquired, why should attention be paid to the Atlantic? In bi-ocean countries such as South Africa or Mexico, there is a choice. Why would Mexico pay attention to Africa, when everything is happening in Asia? However, missing their oceanic potential means missing opportunities. He spoke more specifically of the ATLANTIC FUTURE project, where the Atlantic is looked at as a space, as a point where regions meet, and as a microcosm of what is going on in the world. He carried on by raising the issue of the TTIP. Its signature may reconfigure global and European rules hugely. This could make it impossible for the Atlantic space to break tensions. In conclusion, there is opportunity in the Atlantic, but also real threats. In any case, it is worth exploring it. And by neglecting the Atlantic, we may find that it may become interesting for the wrong reasons, he concluded.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the participants&rsquo; interventions, a debate with the audience ensued around a number of topics and issues. R. Andreas Kraemer was of the opinion that oceans don&rsquo;t divide, as traditionally they have facilitated trade, transfer of ideas, etc. So oceans unite us more that they divide us. Francis Kornegay said that South Africa does not have a geostrategic conception of itself, and that if it did it would try to balance its Indian Ocean with its South Atlantic Ocean potential. On territorial conflicts, Jordi Vaquer pointed out that while the Malvinas issue is a problem in the Atlantic, this does not mean that it has to stop any kind of cooperation, as the Gibraltar conflict between Spain and UK does not, for example. Lorenzo Fioramonti (GovInn, University of Pretoria) enquired whether the Atlantic has a qualitative difference to make, and what it would be. The Atlantic, the participants replied, does make a qualitative difference as it has common understandings of many concepts and we could build on. This is the difference with Asia. Finally, the issue of TTIP was raised again. Valerio Briani (IAI) said that TTIP is probably one of the main things happening in the Atlantic after NATO. R. Andreas Kraemer said that the TTIP is the conflict between rights of corporations and the rights of the people, and the fact that we see it as a geographical thing is a mistake. Jordi Vaquer added that TTIP will have huge negative consequences outside, and it is an affront in Europe. It is an assault of corporate power against democracies, he concluded.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Download the Roundtable Report here:<\/p>","views":"429","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-06-13 10:00:00","modified":"2016-02-05 15:46:16"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"57","content_id":"198","type":"1","file_name":"198-Rountable Report_Economic political and social relations.pdf","description":"","created":"2014-06-13 12:47:45","modified":"2014-06-13 12:47:45"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"3127","content_id":"198","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"3122","content_id":"198","tag_id":"186","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"186","code":"ttip","name":"ttip","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3123","content_id":"198","tag_id":"187","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"187","code":"transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership","name":"transatlantic trade and investment partnership","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3124","content_id":"198","tag_id":"189","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"189","code":"govinn","name":"govinn","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3125","content_id":"198","tag_id":"178","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"178","code":"university-of-pretoria","name":"University of Pretoria","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:52:42","modified":"2014-04-24 14:52:42"}},{"id":"3126","content_id":"198","tag_id":"140","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"3127","content_id":"198","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"197","code":"roundtable-africa-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Roundtable: Africa in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p>The ATLANTIC FUTURE workshop in Pretoria was organized by GovInn (Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation), University of Pretoria, in June 2014. The workshop took place in the frame of the Governance Innovation Week, a series of seminars, workshops, roundtables and keynote lectures dealing with emerging trends in the field of regional integration, supranational governance, sustainable development, alternative economic thinking and civil society.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>As part of the Workshop, a roundtable on \"What role for Africa in a new Atlantic area?\" that gathered a group of experts was held.<\/p>","body":"<p>The rountable \"What role for Africa in a new Atlantic area?\" was chaired by Dr Msukizi Qobo (GovInn, South Africa) and was composed of the following experts:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Jakkie Cilliers (Executive Director of the Institute for Security Studies)<\/li>\r\n<li>Andrew Grant (Professor at Queen&rsquo;s University, Canada)<\/li>\r\n<li>Catherine Grant (South African Institute of International Affairs)<\/li>\r\n<li>Garth Le Pere (University of Pretoria)<\/li>\r\n<li>Brenan Vickers (Institute for Global Dialogue)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The roundtable participants discussed several issues related to the Atlantic, focusing on Africa. Again, one of the topics that drew more attention was the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) currently under negotiation between the EU and the US, and what implications it would have for Africa.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/197-1402655252.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The main ideas that emerged during the roundtable are summarized below.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Jakkie Cilliers<\/strong> emphasized that there is very limited awareness of the Atlantic in Africa, except for the case of Morocco. South Africa, he pointed out, used to have an interest in the Atlantic but no longer has it. South Africa is interested in Asia, the EU and the US. The only real awareness is on overexploitation of resources largely by European companies. On the TTIP, Cilliers made remarks on the geostrategic implications. TTIP is an effort to maintain Western dominance. It changes economic dynamics and it has energy implications, which has a renewed momentum given the Russia - Ukraine issue. So, countries have two options: either to join this one third of the world, or to opt out. For Africa, because there are such low levels of internal trade, the implications of TTIP would be that may force regional integration in Africa, and also force Africa to look further into Asia and the Pacific, because TTIP will cause loss of trade for Africa. For the future of the Atlantic, discussions need to take hard geostrategic drivers into consideration. Countries in the South Atlantic remain much less important countries in this future world, he said.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Andrew Grant <\/strong>spoke aboutaspects that do not get much attention, such as the Kimberly process on diamonds.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Catherine Grant<\/strong> also referred to the TTIP. She said that the reality of economic linkages of South Africa is that there are strong investment ties with the US and the EU. This is not an ideal picture, she said, but it is South Africa&rsquo;s real picture (with the exception of China). And, she added, there is no particular role of Africa in an emerging Atlantic space, as this is very much dominated by the Northern Atlantic. Africa would not favour Atlantic space over other alliances, because we are still seeing the failure of the US and the EU to carry out any real institutional reform in the economic space. When the space is dominated by these two players, and they are not prepared to recognize the changes in the world, why would Africa be interested in pursuing an Atlantic agenda, she wondered.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Garth Le Pere<\/strong> spoke of the two registers along which Africa can be placed in this emerging Atlantic: the instrumental and the normative one. The instrumental one is capitalist in spirit. The normative one is the US and the EU development cooperation agenda (good governance, institutions, etc.). Both tend to reinforce each other, he said. He also talked about the issue of climate change and pointed that Africa has very low and problematic adaptive responses.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Brendan Vickers<\/strong> said that African countries should engage Atlantic counterparts on African priorities. There are three things he considered to be the African priorities: firstly, structural transformation, as Africa needs to shift from export of commodities to a more sustainable growth; secondly, regional and continental integration; and thirdly, infrastructure development. These, he added, are going to require some kind of closer partnership with Atlantic partnership. He also pointed that it makes no sense to speak of one Atlantic region, as one needs to differentiate between North Atlantic and South Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the participants&rsquo; interventions, a lively debate with the audience ensued around a number of topics and issues, particularly on the TTIP. In this sense, <strong>Lorenzo Fioramonti<\/strong> (GovInn, Univesrity of Pretoria), stated that the TTIP is the most astute way of dodging Doha. Is there an Africa proactive reaction to TTIP or are we just waiting for it to happen, he enquired. In Brendan Vickers&rsquo; view, the focus of US and EU is on TTIP, and it is about raising standards. There is very little Africans can do about TTIP, so Africans should focus on what they have control over, that is the regional and continental integration process. The priority should be infrastructure development, etc. There is a need to focus on the continental FTA. Africa needs to become an actor and not a pawn, he added.<\/p>\r\n<p>On another subject, Jakkie Cilliers referred to the idea of a single integrated Africa as a mirage. He also referred to demographics as something that will have a huge impact in the future. Africa is currently one billion people and will be two billion by 2050. On the other hand, Europe is 500 million now and will remain 500 million by 2050. This is something to reflect about, he concluded.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Download the Rountable Report here:<\/p>","views":"269","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-06-13 09:00:00","modified":"2016-02-03 01:53:50"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"56","content_id":"197","type":"1","file_name":"197-Rountable Report_Africa in the Atlantic.pdf","description":"","created":"2014-06-13 12:28:08","modified":"2014-06-13 12:28:08"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"3238","content_id":"197","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"3232","content_id":"197","tag_id":"140","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"3233","content_id":"197","tag_id":"179","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"179","code":"south-africa","name":"South Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:53:06","modified":"2014-04-24 14:53:06"}},{"id":"3234","content_id":"197","tag_id":"186","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"186","code":"ttip","name":"ttip","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3235","content_id":"197","tag_id":"187","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"187","code":"transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership","name":"transatlantic trade and investment partnership","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3236","content_id":"197","tag_id":"178","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"178","code":"university-of-pretoria","name":"University of Pretoria","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:52:42","modified":"2014-04-24 14:52:42"}},{"id":"3237","content_id":"197","tag_id":"189","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"189","code":"govinn","name":"govinn","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"3238","content_id":"197","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"54","code":"seminar-for-young-researchers-in-mexico","user_id":"1","title":"SEMINAR FOR YOUNG RESEARCHERS IN MEXICO","abstract":"<p>On 21 February 2014, CIDE organised a seminar with students of International Relations with an interest in the subject of Atlantic. More than 50 students attended the seminar. Several senior ATLANTIC FUTURE researchers participated in the seminar: R. Andreas Kraemer at Ecologic Institute (Germany), Alfredo Valladao at HEM (Morocco), Paul Isbell at Johns Hopkins University (United States) and Mark Aspinwall at CIDE (Mexico). Lorena Ruano at CIDE (Mexico) acted as the moderator.<\/p>","body":"<p>Lorena Ruano (CIDE) presented the ATLANTIC FUTURE project to the students, highlighting its main features. Next, Alfredo Valladao (HEM) spoke about the strengths of the Atlantic. While everybody talks about the Pacific and the emergence of China, he expressed to be sceptical about that. It is the Atlantic century we are going to see coming up, he noted, and not only the North Atlantic but the South Atlantic too. He made the following points: <strong>the new reserves of energy are in the Atlantic, and energy is the core of development and economic life.<\/strong> There is a huge basin of energy that can put us together and make the Atlantic one of the centres of energy producing of the world. Furthermore, North America and South America are the biggest food producers in the world. Africa and Latin America still have a huge stock of free land and water. There are environmental problems, he conceded, but <strong>we can see the Atlantic as a bread basket for the world<\/strong>. That is a huge area where we can have good cooperation. Thirdly, <strong>the Atlantic is home to huge consumer markets<\/strong>. The US alone represents about 1\/3 of the final private consumer, while China only accounts for 4-5% of the world&rsquo;s private consumption. In a world where consumption leads production, the Atlantic will play an enormous role of consumer market for the world&rsquo;s production. Some countries in Africa are developing fast, which will be a huge opportunity for business, cross-interests, production, consumers, etc. But more important, we are living today a real industrial revolution: from the old model of production chains of mass production for mass consumption to new model: that of ICT tech, 3D printing, advanced robotics, etc. That will be very difficult to replicate in some countries in Asia like China, while in the Atlantic there are a lot of possibilities to do that, where societies open enough to be part of this ICT, to be part of it and take advantage of it. Atlantic will probably be the core of the new revolution of the world. Future economic production and consumption will be more centred in the Atlantic.&nbsp; He clarified, though, that this does not mean that it has to be against the Pacific.<\/p>\r\n<p>Paul Isbell (JHU) added that the <strong>Atlantic<\/strong><strong> is a new unit of analysis as well as a tool for new forms of international collaboration<\/strong>. Coming from a view of the Pacific rise, energy dependence to the Middle East, and the rise of the global South, he explained how when drawing an energy map, it revealed that most mental maps that had to do with the Atlantic and energy were either incorrect or beginning to change dramatically. There is a boom in Atlantic energy resources, reserves, in production, shale revolution, the rising role of gas, and other related forms of energy. The Atlantic is almost self-sufficient in energy. <strong>The energy story is really an Atlantic one<\/strong>, he concluded.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mark Aspinwall (CIDE) added how colonisation had a profound effect in linking together Europe, Africa and the Americas. <strong>The Atlantic is a coherent and fundamentally linked area, where there are important flows in terms of values and ideas<\/strong>. The whole idea of international collaboration and international rules is an Atlantic idea and continue to be generated in the Atlantic in an important way. In terms of economics, there has been a huge increase in services, trade and investment in the Atlantic. In terms of security, continued Lorena Ruano (CIDE), NATO is the main military alliance we have today with the most important capacity in terms of military gear and coordination. But one cannot forget that when thinking about the Atlantic, we mostly think of the North Atlantic. The most important economic exchanges happen in the North Atlantic. <strong>The North Atlantic is still dominant but the fastest rising links are in the South Atlantic<\/strong>, especially between Brazil and Africa. The South Atlantic, she concluded, is coming into the picture very fast.<\/p>\r\n<p>In R. Andreas Kraemer&rsquo;s view (Ecologic Institute), the Atlantic story remains strong. Something very important to consider is <strong>the role of China in the Atlantic<\/strong> today. He also made the point that energy systems, all technology providers, all big companies, are Atlantic, which is very disruptive for the environment. But <strong>there is also a problem of solving capacity<\/strong>. In natural resources there is also disruption (with overfishing, destroyed ecosystems, etc.)&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we try to find the best practices, we find them in the North East Atlantic. We can look at them and apply them in other places.<\/p>\r\n<p>Alfredo Valladao (HEM) pointed at one specific problem: there are many challenges. In terms of civil society, things are going quite well: <strong>there is a huge interchange of values, ideas, and people in the Atlantic<\/strong>. And because there is a lot of freedom of travelling and information, the Atlantic is the cradle of cosmopolitan society. In the business sphere, there are a lot of things going on, services and investment, lot of cross investment in countries in the Atlantic. The real challenge is institutionalizing the dialogue, because of bad perceptions. <strong>The Atlantic probably is the space with more regional integration schemes<\/strong>. Brazil is the &ldquo;big guy&rdquo; in the South Atlantic. While it still sees the South Atlantic as its own, it does not have the capabilities to manage it. It is very important to have a real dialogue with Brazil. And Africa is also key. Finally, he referred to the potential for new form of collaboration. Instead of trying to make big schemes, we should concentrate in solving concrete and specific problems together, such as drug trafficking. To sum up, we should look at solvable problems that are Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>An interesting debate with the students ensued. Questions such as the role of Mexico in the Atlantic, what were the effects of being a dual basin country, or the level of institutionalism in the Atlantic were only a few of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Check photos of the Seminar for Young Researchers below:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395739895.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21.920000076293945px;\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395740829.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395740339.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395741703.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395741302.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395742732.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>","views":"266","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"2","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-03-24 14:54:00","modified":"2016-02-01 20:22:23"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"2694","content_id":"54","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"2675","content_id":"54","tag_id":"153","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

the seminar organized by the ATLANTIC FUTURE, CIDE in Mexico organised a public event with keynote speaker <strong>Jos&eacute; Miguel Insulza, Secretary General of the Organization of American States<\/strong> (OAS) under the title <strong>&ldquo;America in the Atlantic Space&rdquo;<\/strong>. The conference, open to the public and which attracted a large audience, was held at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City on February 21, 2014.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Several issues concerning the role and the future of Latin America in the wider Atlantic space were discussed, with particular attention to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the US and the EU currently under negotiation.<\/p>","body":"<p>The OAS&nbsp;Secretary General Jos&eacute; Miguel Insulza spoke of the renewal of the Atlantic space and noted that the ATLANTIC FUTURE project is very timely in this context. In recent times, there has been an intellectual and political resurrection of the Atlantic, whose decline was announced prematurely. We are almost used to talk about the Pacific century, he said. Certainly, the rise of Asia is a central phenomenon of our era, but this rise does not occur at the expense of the Atlantic. <strong>The 21st century is not the century of the Pacific but the century of globalization<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Insulza noted, as one of the main issues, the <strong>Transatlantic Agreement negotiations on Trade and Investment (TTIP)<\/strong>, which would unite about 50 % of world output and 20% of foreign direct investment if signed. At the same time, he continued, another agreement for the Pacific (TPP) is under negotiation, with 12 countries representing over 38% of world GDP involved. Insulza placed these negotiations in the context of the<strong> emergence of mega - blocks<\/strong>, and noted that these agreements seek to establish new rules that respond to the realities of the 21st century. It is a context of formation of mega-blocks.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Secretary General highlighted the <strong>global value chains as the second major theme in the Atlantic space<\/strong>. He referred to the geographical fragmentation of production, structured in global value chains, and to the fact that the impact on world trade and investment flows are significant. Today, he stressed, the products we receive are \"made in the world&rdquo;. The centre of the value chain will remain where the development of innovation, scientific development and capital is, said Insulza.<\/p>\r\n<p>Insulza referred to Latin America as one of the economic successes of the last decade, but that now faces the risk of not being able to maintain the achievements. They have the challenge of integration into the world economy and its relationship with the mega - blocks as well as the challenge of a more equitable and sustainable growth.<\/p>\r\n<p>He added that export diversification is very important for the Atlantic space in the immediate future. A <strong>greater trade integration of production is needed<\/strong> to reap the benefits of integration. Intraregional trade in Latin America is dominated by trade in final goods. So the challenge may represent a potential transatlantic relations throughout the region. The relationship between the European Union and Latin America has evolved tremendously over the last 30 years. In 2010 Mercosur generated almost half of exports to the European Union. Mexico and Cariforum have a much greater participation in imports from the European Union. There is great potential for growth.<\/p>\r\n<p>Insulza described the fact that most attention goes to Atlantic space because of the start of the negotiations for the TTIP as a great paradox, as this is limited to the more traditional members of the Atlantic Alliance. He warned not to mix the bilateral trade agreement with the creation of a true Atlantic space. <strong>The TTIP is limited to the North Atlantic, but the dialogue should include the rest<\/strong>. Insulza also referred to the importance of South -South relationship. The Secretary- General went on to say that there is a <strong>risk of excluding the South from the dialogue on the Atlantic space<\/strong>. It is time to \"<em>join our voices for a renewed Atlantic space with some cooperation mechanism Atlantic space<\/em>\". In such a framework and voluntarily, Atlantic countries could cooperate on many issues, not only commercial but also environmental and many others.<\/p>\r\n<p>The <strong>emergence of mega - blocks and globalization pose serious challenges<\/strong> for the region. America is the only continent that is Atlantic and Pacific at a time. It could happen that participation in both is possible, or that the label Pacific country or Atlantic country is seen as a new division block.<\/p>\r\n<p>After Jos&eacute; Miguel Isulza speech, a round of questions was opened to the public. Issues such as the negotiation of TTIP, the risks of Mexico looking more towards the Pacific, the key issues for Latin America, or the alleged competition between TPP and TTIP, among others, were addressed.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Download the full conference report here:<\/p>","views":"228","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-02-27 09:00:00","modified":"2016-02-01 20:13:12"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"54","content_id":"196","type":"1","file_name":"196-Conference Report_America in the Atlantic_Mexico.pdf","description":"","created":"2014-06-13 11:40:17","modified":"2014-06-13 11:40:17"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"3176","content_id":"196","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"3170","content_id":"196","tag_id":"170","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"170","code":"mexico","name":"Mexico","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-01-15 11:11:11","modified":"2014-01-15 11:11:11"}},{"id":"3171","content_id":"196","tag_id":"143","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"143","code":"america","name":"America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:41:45","modified":"2013-10-25 10:41:45"}},{"id":"3172","content_id":"196","tag_id":"141","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"141","code":"latin-america","name":"Latin America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:43","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:43"}},{"id":"3173","content_id":"196","tag_id":"153","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

The&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.atlanticdialogues.org\/about-the-atlantic-dialogues\/young-leaders\/atlantic-dialogues-emerging-leaders-agenda-2013\/\"><strong><em>2013 Atlantic Dialogues Emerging Leaders Program<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/a>brought together forty-eight rising leaders from around the Atlantic Basin and focused on the exchange of ideas, peer to peer learning, and skills to effect change. The ATLANTIC FUTURE working session served as the topical introduction to <em>The Atlantic Dialogues<\/em> conference which the young leaders attended as well and where some of the scholars engaged in the ATLANTIC FUTURE project had an active role. Launched in 2012,<em>&nbsp;The Atlantic Dialogues<\/em>&nbsp;is emerging as a leading annual forum for decision makers to discuss global issues and partnerships, with an emphasis on the Southern Atlantic and transatlantic relations beyond traditional north-north lines. This high-level gathering is a unique opportunity for leaders from the four continents of the Atlantic to debate the changing dynamics across the wider basin and help shape the broader transatlantic agenda.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ATLANTIC FUTURE working lunch started with opening remarks by Corinna H&ouml;rst, Deputy Director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States&rsquo; Brussels office, in which she presented the ATLANTIC FUTURE project in a global context and introduced the goals and deliverables. The following group discussions focused on multilateralism (WP1), economic trends (WP2), security issues (WP3), norms in the Atlantic (WP4\/5), and regionalism (WP8).<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>The Atlantic world and the Future of Multilateralism<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Atlantic world and the Future of Multilateralism&rdquo; discussion was chaired by Emiliano Alessandri, Senior Transatlantic Fellow, German Marshall Fund of the United States. In light of changing dynamics in global and regional multilateral organizations, the discussion focused on whether ongoing power shifts will lead to more or less multilateralism in the Atlantic. Other axis of reflection included the impact of growing economic interdependence on international cooperation around the Atlantic Basin and what Atlantic dynamics can tell us about larger developments at the global level.<\/p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li><strong>Overcoming the North-South Divide: Economic Re-balancing in the Atlantic<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>This discussion was chaired by Chris Hoornaert, Ambassador of the Port Authority of Antwerp, Port Authority of Antwerp and focused on trends in trade and investment in the Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>The South Atlantic space has in the last decade won greater economic and political autonomy from the United States and Europe. Trade and investment have been growing fast in the South-South Atlantic relationship, and the regions of the South are also witnessing a reconfiguration in political influence. China has become a major partner of African as well as Latin American economies. The rift between the West and the Global South still defines to a large extent the rules for interaction but new relationships are also emerging that defy the North-South divide. In this context, the discussion also addressed the question of the extent to which, asthe South Atlantic space gains greater economic weight, re-balancing will lead to greater cooperation or competition in the region.<\/p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong>Atlantic Security: Towards a Pan-Atlantic approach?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>Nicoletta Pirozzi, Senior Fellow, Istituto Affari Internazionali chaired the discussion &ldquo;Atlantic Security: Towards a Pan-Atlantic approach?&rdquo; The Atlantic North and South have witnessed much lower levels of inter-state conflict than other areas of the world, and the South Atlantic is one of the few regions of the world that is free of weapons of mass destruction. Nonetheless, as some states grow stronger than others and competition for resources increases, military build-ups or other forms of traditional threats should not be discarded. In this context the discussion centered on the likelihood for new comprehensive Atlantic cooperation frameworks and the areas of security policy in which greater progress could be made.<\/p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li><strong>Moving in the Same Direction? Norms in the Atlantic.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Moving in the Same Direction? Norms in the Atlantic&rdquo; was chaired by Camilla Adelle, Research Fellow at the University of Pretoria. This session addressed the role of transnational networks of state and non-state actors in the soft transfer of ideas, norms and principles in building an Atlantic region. Areas covered include: whether the pan-Atlantic region is becoming a &ldquo;community&rdquo; in which key ideas, norms, and principles are bound to converge; which are the most relevant processes through which ideas, norms, and principles are transferred, contested, and re-conceptualized; whether the North-South rebalancing overall is leading to greater alignment or discrepancy between value systems; and what sub-regions or countries can play a leading role moving the debate on norms forward at the Atlantic level?<\/p>\r\n<p>5.<strong> Shifting Regionalism<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>R. Andreas Kraemer, Founding Director and CEO, Ecologic Institute,Berlin, chaired the discussion on &ldquo;Shifting Regionalism.&rdquo; This conversation focused on whether and how the emergence of powerful regional actors having an impact on regional integration processes and affecting inter-regional cooperation across the Atlantic Basin. The emerging leaders also discussed the direction of regional integration, whether actors around the Atlantic Basin are moving toward greater simplification of regional cooperation efforts or greater diversity and plurality of initiatives.<\/p>\r\n<p>The participants were very enthusiastic about the opportunity to engage with the senior scholars and learn about different perspectives to the Atlantic space and engaged in lively discussions on topics relevant to the Atlantic Future project. Indeed, the sessions provided this diverse group of Emerging Leaders with new perspectives on transatlantic relations, as a whole, and their respective topics more specifically. The emerging leaders were better able to identify and conceptualize the wider Atlantic space through the working lunch discussions. By addressing issues from security to trade through the lens of the Atlantic Basin, the ATLANTIC FUTURE working lunch prepared the Emerging Leaders to take full advantage of the exchanges during the <em>Atlantic Dialogues<\/em>, imprinting on them a lasting understanding of this &ldquo;new&rdquo; geopolitical space. The working lunch also provided researchers of the ATLANTIC FUTURE project with an opportunity to discuss their findings with a critical audience, and gain input on their research from Emerging Leaders from Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, and Europe.<\/p>\r\n<p>A PDF presentation of the Working Lunch is attached.<\/p>\r\n<p>Check photos of the Working Lunch below:<\/p>\r\n<p

in Rabat, Morocco, where a panel of experts shared their interesting views on the topic with an audience of 200 people. The event took place on 25 October 2013 at <em>Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale du Royaume du Maroc<\/em> (Morocco National Library), after a 2-day seminar as part of the first plenary meeting of the ATLANTIC FUTURE.<\/p>","body":"<p>The conference was chaired by Driss Ksikes (Director of CESEM, HEM) and counted with a panel of five speakers: Abderrahmane Hadj Nacer, economist and former governor of the Central Bank of Algeria, Bichara Khader, Professor at UCL, Belgium, Karim El Aynaoui, Senior Researcher at OCP Policy Center, Alfredo Valladao, Senior Researcher at HEM and Jordi Vaquer, Senior Associate of CIDOB and Scientific Coordinator of ATLANTIC FUTURE.<\/p>\r\n<p>The speakers covered a wide range of topics related to the Arab world and the Atlantic space. The chair <strong>Driss Ksikes<\/strong> opened the conference by giving an overview of the project Atlantic Future and by pointing at the Atlantic potential for growth. He referred to Morocco as a country that materializes the link between the Arab world and the Atlantic space. <strong>Bichara Khader<\/strong> spoke of the extreme verticality of the relationship between Europe and the Maghreb and of the need for Arab countries to reach Africa and Latin America. The exchanges between Brazil and the Arab world have increased a lot in the recent times. He also referred to the role of new international actors such as China or the United States in the years to come<strong>.<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Abderrahmane<\/strong> <strong>Hadj Nasser <\/strong>spoke of the relevance of monetary control. Money is trust. He referred to the Quincy Agreement in 1945 between U.S. president Roosevelt and the King of Saudi Arabia. In his view, the agreement represented that trust is no longer based on a particular resource but on the authoritarian control of resources.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Jordi Vaquer<\/strong> said that there is a tendency to forget Africa in the Atlantic history. He viewed the Atlantic no only as an area of opportunities but also of threats to certain countries, due to issues such as piracy or the drug trafficking routes. He also referred to fragile countries and also to other countries that are well governed but that despite this they are still vulnerable, such as the case of Cape Verde. On the cultural field, he insisted on the great amount of links that exist within the Atlantic space. A great part of the music in the world, for example, is of Atlantic origin. Referring to social links, he spoke of the change that has taken place, as flows are not one-way anymore. For example, there are more Portuguese citizens in Angola now than there were in the colonial times, and Morocco can also be an opportunity for Spanish citizens. He also referred to social movements in Tunisia or Morocco, which inspired the 15-M in Spain, the Somos 37 in Chile, etc. He also referred to food security as an important issue in the Atlantic. While the Atlantic contains the biggest amounts of water reserves, there are areas (such as Subsaharan Africa) that suffer food security issues.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Alfredo Valladao<\/strong> focused on the relationship between the Gulf countries and the BRICs, and referred to the shift towards the Atlantic in the oil production. The geopolitical implications of such shift are enormous, he said, as Gulf countries face a loss of negotiation and strategic power. He also spoke of the strong dependency of BRICs towards China and India. On China, he referred to potential internal problems that could affect its growth.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Karim El Aynaoui<\/strong> pointed out that Brazil and China growth is slowing down. He also criticized Europe for not being aware of the developments in the South. The flow of production factors, he said, is an important question. He concluded that here are many questions that need to be posed in order to understand the current shifts.<\/p>\r\n<p>An interesting debate and exchange of ideas ensured among the speakers on different topics and issues.<strong> Driss Ksikes<\/strong> added that there is a perception that the Atlantic is a pacific area and that it is a community of values. He wondered whether there is a clash between the values of the Arab \/ Islam world and the values of the Atlantic world. Also, he questioned the implications of the loss of strategic power of the Gulf countries. He finally referred to the potential of innovation and mobility within the Atlantic space. On a different topic, <strong>Abderrahmane<\/strong> <strong>Hadj Nasser<\/strong> referred to wahabism, and pointed that flows and linkages mean to be conditioned to the rest of the world, and therefore it is important to integrate wahabism. <strong>Bichara Khader<\/strong> regretted the fact that the Arab world is closed due to internal problems in a time when the world is being redesigned. <strong>Karim El Aynaoui<\/strong> added that Morocco has to define its place in the Atlantic. <strong>Alfredo Valladao<\/strong> also spoke of the fundamental role of the Atlantic space as an area of connections, exchange of ideas, capacity to intermix, and great capabilities for dialogue. <strong>Jordi Vaquer<\/strong> concluded that the Atlantic space will be built through a tissue of links rather than through a big institution, and through bilateral relations rather than based on a comprehensive agreement.<\/p>\r\n<p>The floor was opened to the public and a very lively debate ensued with the audience, with issues such as the relationship between development and peace, climate change, food security, piracy or energy poverty, among others.<\/p>\r\n<p>The conference was conducted in French and translation services into English were available.<\/p>\r\n<p>A Pdf version of the report is attached.<\/p>\r\n<p>Below you can see some photos of the event.<\/p>\r\n<p

Within the Atlantic space, there are growing links in the fields of energy, commerce, human security, norms, values and other issues related to the ocean itself. As interdependency relations grow through this basin, new opportunities emerge, but also new vulnerabilities affect its interlinking societies. With more and more urgent common problems, Atlantic states and regions are seeking with renewed interest their counterparts in all shores of the ocean. Authors from different shores of the Atlantic, some of them partners of ATLANTIC FUTURE or members of our Scientific and Advisory Panel, analyse from a wide range of theoretical and empirical orientations the consequences of the current changes and transformations within the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p>Check the contents <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cidob.org\/en\/publications\/publication_series\/revista_cidob_d_afers_internacionals\/rediscovering_the_atlantic_space\" target=\"_blank\">here.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cidob.org\/en\/publications\/articulos\/revista_cidob_d_afers_internacionals\/102_103\/introduction_a_new_perspective_on_the_atlantic\">Introduction: a new perspective on the Atlantic<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Anna Ayuso and Elina Viilup<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cidob.org\/en\/publications\/articulos\/revista_cidob_d_afers_internacionals\/102_103\/atlantic_communities_asymmetries_and_convergences\">Atlantic communities: asymmetries and convergences<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Dorval Brunelle<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cidob.org\/en\/publications\/articulos\/revista_cidob_d_afers_internacionals\/102_103\/towards_a_governance_agenda_for_the_emerging_atlantic_hemisphere\">Towards a governance agenda for the emerging Atlantic Hemisphere<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Daniel S.

Trade and investment have been growing fast in the South-South Atlantic relationship, and the regions of the South are also witnessing a reconfiguration in political influence.<\/p>","body":"<p>The South Atlantic space has in the last decade won greater economic and political autonomy from the US and Europe. The dynamic Asian markets have driven the economic growth of major South American countries (such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile or Peru), most notably in the sector of commodities, both non-renewable (such as mineral and fossil fuels) and renewable (such as agricultural products). Asian, mainly Chinese, products have been flooding markets across the region. An even more dramatic shift has taken place in Africa, where the search for commodities has attracted unprecedented levels of Chinese investment, and has fuelled economic growth and further investment from other non-traditional sources such as the Gulf States, India, Malaysia or Brazil.<\/p>\r\n<p>Trade and investment in the South-South Atlantic have been growing fast, both within the Atlantic space and between the Atlantic and extra-Atlantic partners. Trade between Brazil and Africa has increased six fold between 2000 and 2011 (from US$4.2 billion to US$27.6 billion), and Brazil is the third largest trade partner of Africa as a whole, after China and India. Oil-producing Nigeria and Angola account for almost 50% of these trade flows. At the same time, China-Africa trade, driven by commodities, has grown more than ten-fold over the last decade, doubling in nominal terms every three years. The share of Brazil&rsquo;s trade with the other BRICs jumped from 9% to 17% in the space of only three years, from 2006 to 2009. The old, largely rhetoric South-South cooperation has evolved into a complex relationship which involves a growing number of actors with different objectives; among them are transnational corporations and powerful lobbies but also cities, language communities or diasporas.<\/p>\r\n<p>The regions of the South are also witnessing a reconfiguration in political influence. North Atlantic powers are losing ground, thus allowing non-Atlantic actors to seek new influence and regional actors to emerge. In Sub-Saharan Africa, political investment by South Africa and other regional players in the African Union and sub-regional organizations is paralleled by a creeping &lsquo;multipolarisation&rsquo; of continental politics. In particular, South Africa and Nigeria aim to consolidate their role as regional leaders and important interlocutors for third partners beyond Africa. Together with Brazil and India, South Africa has launched the IBSA format for political dialogue and economic cooperation, has invested in the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) platform on climate change negotiations and joined the BRICS in 2011. At the same time, it has developed a strategic partnership with the EU, with the latter seeking to strike a new balance between bilateral and inter-regional engagement both in Africa and in South America. Nigeria is seeking political benefits from its pivotal role in energy flows, accounting for 11% of US oil imports, 16% of South Africa&rsquo;s and 8% of India&rsquo;s.<\/p>\r\n<p>North Africa, long time stagnant at the political and economic level, is at the heart of changes that are shaking the Arab world and transforming its political and social landscape. The problems that still trouble the region &ndash; youth unemployment, gender inequality, lack of competitiveness and dismal research and innovation rates &ndash; could be overcome faster than expected if the current transformation liberates new creative energies in all fields, from economy to social structures. North Africa is moving beyond its dependency on Europe and slowly globalizing its international partners, searching for new opportunities in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Gulf.<\/p>\r\n<p>In South America, Brazil&rsquo;s external projection is manifest in its solid regional engagement and good cooperation with its neighbours. Brazil, as a leading investor in South America, has sought to deliver new impulse to MERCOSUR (Common Southern Market) and is providing political impetus to regional cooperation through new formats such as UNASUR (Union of South American Nations) and the CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States). Also thanks to such initiatives, cooperation and integration processes have acquired new dynamism in South America. A shift has been taking place from mainly liberalisation-based economic integration towards a more physical and political agenda that includes asymmetries, complementarities and dispute resolution forums. Against this backdrop, the US and the EU have reached out to Brazil to establish and develop bilateral strategic partnerships.<\/p>","views":"523","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"2","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-07-24 18:26:00","modified":"2016-02-05

A global order in evolution contextualises the research of ATLANTIC FUTURE.<\/p>","body":"<p>The international order, as established at the end of World War II, has changed beyond recognition over the last two decades. The triumph of the North Atlantic powers in the Cold War slowly started to give way to <strong>a redistribution of power in all its dimensions<\/strong> (hard and soft, political and economic), which currently is the predominant trend reshaping the international system. It includes both <strong>power shifts among state actors, most notably towards Asia, and the diffusion of power away from states to a variety of non-state actors.<\/strong> However, that power transition does not seem to lead to a succession of US pre-eminence. On the one hand, the material resources of the US remain unparalleled across most dimensions of power, although the economic crisis is seriously affecting the country&rsquo;s profile on the international stage. On the other hand, no individual country, or group of countries, seems able to replace the US in its traditional role of milieu-shaping and provision of global public goods for the foreseeable future. Reforming multilateral frameworks, therefore, is going to be critical to ensure openness and stability of a polycentric international system. Creation of new formats such as the G20 and a progressive transformation of existing institutions, such as the IMF, are part of the adjustment to the new realities. A more open multilateralism is emerging with the diversification of the multilateral playing fields and the emergence of new actors in multilateralism other than states.<\/p>\r\n<p>A general shift of power away from the Northern Atlantic towards the Pacific, or even the Asian heartland, is a defining feature of contemporary international relations, particularly in terms of economic dynamism. The centre of growth is situated in Asia, with China as a major player. Latin America, with Brazilian leadership, and more recently also Africa are playing a growing role on the international stage.<strong> This shift of power towards the Global South is rebalancing relations around and within the Atlantic space<\/strong>. Until recently the North America-Europe transatlantic link was overwhelmingly predominant in the region. North-South relations between the USA and Latin America and Europe and Africa have suffered from a profound asymmetry. However, slowly the space is opening up and multiple levels of engagement are developing across the Atlantic space and with partners in other regions. Regional formats and bilateral partnerships are redrawing the political map of the Atlantic, including a proliferation of South-South links as well as triangulations between advanced, middle income and developing partners (e.g. the trilateral alliance between Brazil, South Africa and India or the BRICS). Large emerging powers such as Brazil reach out to Africa and aim to play a bigger role on global issues in multilateral and mini-lateral fora.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"158","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"1","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-05-02 10:45:00","modified":"2016-02-08

perhaps the predominant trend reshaping the international system. Different authors have offered different readings and conceptualisations of the erosion of American and Western predominance coining concepts such as multipolar world, a post-American world or a non-polar world. ATLANTIC FUTURE adopts a distinct position.<\/p>","body":"<p>ATLANTIC FUTURE adopts the concept of interpolarity, coined by the researcher Giovanni Grevi. It is ATLANTIC FUTURE&rsquo;s assumption that we live in an interpolar world, where multipolarity and interdependence are equally important. On the one hand, by rescuing polarity we are able to defend the central role of the state, which allows, among other things, to account for the rise of China, Brazil and other emerging state powers. On the other hand, interdependence captures the links not only among states but also among non-state actors, and stresses the increasing interconnectedness among international actors and issues and technological advance and the diffusion of power.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Atlantic, the space where American and, before that, European pre-eminence was most evident in the past, is changing fast, and its study can yield useful insights into how interpolarity works in practice. When looking at relations between large and middle powers, sheer balance of power paradigms fit international politics in the Atlantic space less than the more nuanced concept of interpolarity. The latter does not exclude or neglect competition or hard geopolitical considerations, but sets them in the broader framework of interdependence. This is all the more relevant in a context such as the Atlantic where relations between the main state actors are predominantly not defined in antagonistic terms and trans-national threats are largely common ones. An interpolar system is interest-based, problem driven and process-oriented. Focusing on interests does not mean emphasising ruthless self-interest only but also exploring the scope for the convergence of national interests, and relevant incentives. Numerous challenges across the Atlantic require cooperative solutions and awareness of such imperative across different regions, while arguably growing, needs scrutiny. For example, organised crime or climate change affect different countries in different ways.<\/p>","views":"274","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"2","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-05-01 16:24:00","modified":"2016-02-05 22:12:22"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"1439","content_id":"3","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"1428","content_id":"3","tag_id":"123","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"123","code":"international-balance-of-power","name":"International balance of power","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 09:50:08","modified":"2013-09-30 09:50:08"}},{"id":"1429","content_id":"3","tag_id":"121","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"121","code":"interdependence","name":"Interdependence","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 13:12:07","modified":"2013-09-27 13:12:07"}},{"id":"1430","content_id":"3","tag_id":"11","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"11","code":"multipolarity","name":"Multipolarity","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:04:11","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:11"}},{"id":"1431","content_id":"3","tag_id":"42","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"42","code":"brics","name":"BRICS","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:56:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:56:17"}},{"id":"1432","content_id":"3","tag_id":"5","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"5","code":"atlantic-space","name":"Atlantic space","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:55:08","modified":"2013-09-27 09:55:08"}},{"id":"1433","content_id":"3","tag_id":"138","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"138","code":"europe","name":"Europe","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:16:35","modified":"2013-10-25 10:16:35"}},{"id":"1434","content_id":"3","tag_id":"7","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"7","code":"power","name":"Power","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:05:06","modified":"2013-09-27 10:05:06"}},{"id":"1435","content_id":"3","tag_id":"41","order":"8","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"41","code":"actors","name":"Actors","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:53:51","modified":"2013-09-27 09:53:51"}},{"id":"1436","content_id":"3","tag_id":"143","order":"9","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"143","code":"america","name":"America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:41:45","modified":"2013-10-25 10:41:45"}},{"id":"1437","content_id":"3","tag_id":"3","order":"10","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"3","code":"west","name":"West","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:21","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:21"}},{"id":"1438","content_id":"3","tag_id":"147","order":"11","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"147","code":"international-relations","name":"international relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-11-18 11:32:59","modified":"2013-11-18 11:32:59"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"1439","content_id":"3","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"5","code":"the-thematic-areas-of-atlantic-future","user_id":"1","title":"The thematic areas of ATLANTIC FUTURE","abstract":"<p>Four main areas have been identified as the main potential drivers for cooperation in the Atlantic. ATLANTIC FUTURE will obtain information and a mental map of the trends in these issue areas.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","body":"<p>ATLANTIC FUTURE work focuses on four thematic areas: economy and finance, security, political, social and cultural relations, and resources and environment.<\/p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Economy and Finance<\/em><\/h3>\r\n<p>Economic links are at the forefront of the transformation of the Atlantic world. Changes in global finances are markedly reflected in the region. Global and regional economic growth is at the same time the result of and the stimulus for a large increase in trade flows and their diversification. Financial flows across the region take very different shapes: transfers resulting from trade imbalances, credit and financial investment, FDI, development aid and migrant remittances, to name only the most significant. Each of them is undergoing substantial change across the Atlantic. Tourism is also playing a growing role in linking regions together. All those flows are the background for the emergence of new routes of transportation, both over the sea and by air, and even of pan-Atlantic infrastructure, such as undersea internet cable connections.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Security<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Compared to the Pacific or the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic does not appear as a source of global insecurities or tensions. The relations between most powers in the area are relatively cordial and where there is open antagonism, for example between Cuba and the United States, or open territorial grievances, like between Great Britain and Argentina over the Malvinas\/Falklands or between Spain and Morocco over the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, an open military conflict seems a remote possibility. However, under that quiet surface, a military build-up in Latin America serves as a reminder that not all conventional threats can be safely discarded in the Atlantic. This holds even truer for non-conventional threats. The lethal combination between fragile states, lucrative narcotics smuggling routes and vast sea and land borders that are difficult to control, links the countries on both sides of the Central Atlantic in a vicious circle of violence, poverty, instability and all forms of organised crime. As traffic grows along the Atlantic sea lanes, maritime security becomes a regional and a global concern, in particular in view of the increase in piracy activities in the Gulf of Guinea or drug trafficking across the Atlantic sores.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>People and Institutions<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Large and mid-sized players, notably emerging ones in South America and Africa, pursue a multi-vector foreign policy that result in new diplomatic and political ties. Brazil and South Africa, closely followed by other middle regional players such as Argentina, Colombia or Nigeria, feature multiple identities as developing and middle-income countries, champions of the South, protagonists of the global economy, leaders of regional cooperation and pioneers of new partnerships across the Atlantic as well as with other regions of the world. The North Atlantic actors cannot assume that predominance of democratic governance in Africa and South America will necessarily result in convergence of values and perceptions, and even less in automatic alliances on global issues. Contrasting perspectives on such crucial issues as human rights or democratisation can become significant obstacles to a wider Atlantic cooperation. The proliferation of actors and agendas challenges the traditional approach of the US and the EU towards their Southern neighbours in the Atlantic space but also bears the seeds of new opportunities for cooperation and mutual benefit. A number of variables, both internal and external to the Atlantic space, will determine whether these seeds will bear fruit.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Resources and Environment<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Energy and climate issues, in particular, have become key Atlantic vectors, as an incipient &ldquo;Atlantic Basin energy system&rdquo; (re)emerges as an important subsystem within the global political and energy economy, alongside the Pacific and Indian Ocean Basin-systems. The energy map of the Atlantic area is one that reflects not only the very different real income and consumption levels of the Atlantic continents, but also the divergent energy economies and distinct energy policy environments and evolutions. Key global trends (including climate change, intensifying competition for resources, the imperative to eliminate poverty) are pushing in the direction of energy policy and regulatory convergence within the Atlantic Basin and toward a deepening of transatlantic energy trade and investment. The Southern Cone and Southern Africa have recently emerged as new centers of gravity within the energy landscape of the Atlantic Basin. Many new energy trends are now emerging in the Southern Atlantic, although the unconventional gas revolution in the United States is shifting energy trade patterns, and the search for renewables on each Atlantic continent also offers considerable potential for transformation. The Atlantic Basin accounts for approximately one-third of both global oil and gas production. Over 40% of world petroleum reserves and nearly 12% of global conventional gas reserves are located in the Atlantic world. These figures are also likely to increase in coming years, as more unconventional oil sources - offshore oil, Arctic oil, and shale gas - are discovered, then classified as proven reserves, and eventually brought online as new production. The Southern Atlantic alone could account for as much as 20% of global energy demand by 2035, with the entire Atlantic Basin contributing nearly half. The expected boom in Southern Atlantic energy demand lends the Atlantic Basin energy space more critical mass within the global energy system.<\/p>","views":"393","shares":"1","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-04-19 18:29:00","modified":"2016-02-06

(CIDE) and<em>&nbsp;Outlook for the Fossil Fuel and Renewable Energy Industries in the Wider Atlantic Space <\/em>by&nbsp;Christoph H. Stefes and R. Andreas Kraemer Ecologic Institute Berlin<\/p>","body":"<p><em>Economic and financial links <\/em>are strong across the Atlantic space, especially the North Atlantic. While North-South and South-South links are growing, they are influenced by the presence of external factors, like China or the price of commodities. There is strong evidence of continued and lasting economic interaction among the developed Atlantic in the north, and there does appear to be some trend toward the integration of Africa and Latin America into the Atlantic (and global) trade and investment regimes, through their northern partners, partly because of the rise of emerging market economies (especially Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa) and partly because of decisions to increase South-South economic interactions.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Fossil Fuel and Renewable Energy Industries<\/em> explains that although, the Atlantic Space holds a large share of the world&rsquo;s unexploited fossil fuel reserves, including 40% of oil reserves, 20% of natural gas reserves, and roughly 40% of coal reserves (BP 2015), the future of the industry is uncertain. Large profit margins (in the past) and continued subsides have made some of these unconventional and difficult hydrocarbon reserves easier to access via new technologies, particularly in the cases of the North Atlantic shale revolution and the Southern Atlantic &ldquo;oil ring&rdquo; ( Isbell 2014). In the North Atlantic, shale gas now accounts for more than 35% of American gas production, compared to 2% in 2000. Demand for shale oil and gas is predicted to rise from 1.96 BCM\/day to 2.69 BCM\/day by 2035 (Szalai 2013). In the Southern Atlantic oil ring, deep-water offshore oil rigs now span from Namibia and Morocco in the east to Argentina and the Gulf of Mexico (Isbell 2014), but their further expansion is in doubt given current and projected oil prices.<\/p>","views":"378","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-12-03 12:16:00","modified":"2016-02-08 11:52:48"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"182","content_id":"1599","type":"1","file_name":"1599-Economic and financial links in the Atlantic Space.pdf","description":"Economic and financial links in the Atlantic Space","created":"2015-12-03 12:42:22","modified":"2015-12-03 12:42:22"},{"id":"183","content_id":"1599","type":"1","file_name":"1599-Outlook for the fossil fuel and renewable energy industries in the wider Atlantic Space.pdf","description":"Outlook for the Fossil fuel and renewable energy industries in the Wider Atlantic Sapce","created":"2015-12-03 12:49:05","modified":"2015-12-03 12:49:05"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"7346","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"7338","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"20","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"7339","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"139","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"139","code":"asia","name":"Asia","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:25","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:25"}},{"id":"7340","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"140","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"7341","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"141","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"141","code":"latin-america","name":"Latin America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:43","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:43"}},{"id":"7342","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"206","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"206","code":"economic-integration","name":"economic integration","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7343","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"26","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"7344","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"108","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"108","code":"energy","name":"Energy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:45","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:45"}},{"id":"7345","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"150","order":"8","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"7346","content_id":"1599","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1532","code":"africa-and-the-eu","user_id":"1","title":"Africa and the EU","abstract":"<p>Working paper The EU and Africa:&nbsp;Regionalism and interregionalism beyond institutions, by&nbsp;Nicoletta Pirozzi,&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

The analysis focuses on institutionalized regionalism and interregionalism between the European Union (EU) and the African Union (AU), as well as regional organizations in Southern, West and East Africa in the three sectors of trade; security; and environment. It also goes beyond by addressing and comparing formal and informal, state and non-state, patterns of integration at regional and transnational levels.<\/p>\r\n<p>The paper concludes that the EU and AU present many commonalties in terms of institutional architecture. Nevertheless, if we look at the reality of their achievements, it emerges that the two organizations evolved at different pace, with the AU lagging behind, also due to the fact that the integration process in the two regions is confronted with different challenges.In terms of interregional relations, it appears that the EU has heavily influenced the development of regionalism in Africa mainly through teaching and support. The relationship between the EU and African regions is fundamentally characterized by the former influencing regional policy of, and providing funds and capacity building to, the latter.<\/p>","views":"254","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-11-17 12:30:00","modified":"2016-02-08 14:09:42"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"178","content_id":"1532","type":"1","file_name":"1532-EU-Africa.pdf","description":"The EU and Africa: Regionalism and interregionalism beyond institutions\r\n","created":"2015-11-17 12:30:47","modified":"2015-11-17 12:30:47"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"7330","content_id":"1532","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"7324","content_id":"1532","tag_id":"287","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"287","code":"interregionalism","name":"interregionalism","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7325","content_id":"1532","tag_id":"286","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"286","code":"eu","name":"eu","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7326","content_id":"1532","tag_id":"137","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"137","code":"european-union","name":"European Union","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:16:06","modified":"2013-10-25 10:16:06"}},{"id":"7327","content_id":"1532","tag_id":"140","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"7328","content_id":"1532","tag_id":"178","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"178","code":"university-of-pretoria","name":"University of Pretoria","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:52:42","modified":"2014-04-24 14:52:42"}},{"id":"7329","content_id":"1532","tag_id":"150","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"7330","content_id":"1532","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1530","code":"latin-america-and-the-eu","user_id":"1","title":"Latin America and the EU","abstract":"<p><strong>Working paper EU-Latin America and Caribbean Inter-regional relations: complexity and change, by&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Gian Luca Gardini,&nbsp;<\/strong>University Erlangen-N&uuml;rnberg, and&nbsp;<strong>Anna Ayuso,&nbsp;<\/strong>CIDOB<\/p>","body":"<p>This paper analyses regionalism in Latin America and the Caribbean and interregionalism between this region and the European Union.

His current research focuses on the role and functions of science-based policy institutes or \"think tanks\" in theory and practice, the interactions among policy domains and international relations, and global governance on environment, resources, climate and energy<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: <\/strong><strong>What do you see when you look at the energy sector through an Atlantic lens?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: The world&rsquo;s energy systems are Atlantic. This is true for coal, the fuel that started the industrial revolution and powered industry and especially mining. It is also true for other fossil energy carriers: oil including shale oil and tar sands and methane. The nuclear industry started in the WWII era in the North Atlantic and financially sustained by Atlantic government subsidies before going global.&nbsp; The recent onset of fracking is an essentially North American phenomenon.<\/p>\r\n<p>Early development of renewable energy technologies including solar energy and wind turbines started in the US before globalizing. Bio-energy at industrial scale is also of Atlantic provenance, from sugar cane to alcohol as transport fuel in Brazil, corn-to-ethanol for fuel blending in the US, to canola (rape seed) to bio-diesel or general agricultural waste to biogas to bio-genic electricity in the EU.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: <\/strong><strong>What are the trends and dynamics of energy in the Atlantic space?&nbsp; <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: Nuclear power and fossil energies are declining due to generally rising long-term costs. Many companies are heading for write-downs, economic abandonment or insolvency and possible government bail-outs. The Atlantic nations have overdeveloped both fossil and nuclear energy, incurring enormous political and security costs, e.g. climate change.<\/p>\r\n<p>Renewable energy development and use is increasing, but at different rates and sometimes from a low starting basis. Cost improvements result from new inventions, material discoveries as well as technological, business, and policy learning curves, particularly for solar energy and storage. The roll-out of IT-based technology is accelerating both in relation to existing technologies and the investment and development of new energy systems. This transformation is proving disruptive to the old, dirty and dangerous fossil and nuclear energy industries. The Age of Energy Transformation away from fossil and nuclear towards renewable energy supply with storage in a smart grid is originally an Atlantic phenomenon, conceived as an idea by Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute in the US, and now epitomised by the German \"Energiewende\" entering practically all Atlantic languages.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What does the Atlantic future energy system look like?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: While the true costs of fossil and nuclear systems are becoming ever more obvious, pressure mounts for public budgets to phase-out the perverse subsidies that favour them. Energy efficiency, renewable and storage technologies are becoming ever cheaper. As a consequence, energy-related trade and investment patterns will change. Instead of energy carriers such as coal and gas being traded, it will be equipment for renewable power generation and storage for various kinds. The total cost of energy supply will decline, and asset values of energy infrastructure will fall. More energy will be consumed close to the point of production.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;What are the trigger points of potential cooperation in the Atlantic space?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: Atlantic nations should cooperate to accelerate the energy transformation. A key measure is reforming energy-related taxation, including scrapping perverse subsidies and privileges for fossil and nuclear energy. Governments should agree to facilitate the trade in goods and services relating to energy efficiency, renewable energies, storage and smart grids. Tariffs still imposed should be removed, perhaps by \"coordinated unilateralism\".&nbsp; Local, regional or national content obligations in government procurement rules should be scrapped. In order to facilitate the trade in biogenic energy, stringent sustainability criteria should be agreed for the production and processing of biomass. The Atlantic nations might follow the \"top-runner\" approach so that the best practice concerning energy efficiency or energy conversion in any one country or company becomes the norm after 3 or 5 years. That would speed invention, innovation and dissemination of desirable technologies throughout the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the Atlantic Voices here:<\/strong><\/p>","views":"952","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-10-08 17:13:00","modified":"2016-02-08 04:00:01"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"171","content_id":"1131","type":"1","file_name":"1131-ATLANTIC VOICES_02_R.A.

With this objective in mind regional trends and dynamics have been presented and analysed in this paper. However, interviewees not only had particular difficulty thinking about the Atlantic in terms of a unified geopolitical space but also agreed that, for the time being at least, we could not speak of the emergence of this geopolitical space. Because, despite the common ground that exists among the regions of the Atlantic, the context of international reconfiguration being experienced today, and the prevalence of national and regional dynamics still have direct impact on the social and political mindset of the Atlantic sub-regions. For the interviewees, the notion of the Atlantic space is simply not in the quintessence&nbsp;of the region and lacks the political leadership that is needed for this.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from International Organizations in New York and Washington, D.C.<\/strong>(by Elizabeth Tedsen,Ecologic Institute)<\/p>\r\n<p>The conventional dynamics of pan-Atlantic relations and North-South dichotomy have changed dramatically over the past ten to twenty years, with Southern countries rising to greater economic and political prominence. Fundamental changes are taking place within and between Atlantic countries, yet many of these are eclipsed by, or ultimately part of, growing globalization and multipolarity. These may be accompanied by the relative decline of the European Union as it turns inward to meet internal challenges and as political and economic gravities shift. Historical and cultural ties provide a deep foundation for interregional cooperation between Atlantic countries on issues such as trade, drug trafficking, and governance of shared commons.&nbsp; Yet whether these ties can form the basis for a new &ldquo;Atlantic Rim,&rdquo; or whether instead the dynamics and trends within the Atlantic herald an increasingly interconnected and globalized world whereby the relevance of these linkages weakens, remains to be seen.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the two papers here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"162","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-10-07 10:17:00","modified":"2016-02-03 05:20:35"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"145","content_id":"1108","type":"1","file_name":"1108-ATLANTIC FUTURE_Perspectives from IO in Geneva.pdf","description":"Perspectives from International Organizations in Geneva (by Paula de Castro, CIDOB)","created":"2015-09-08 10:18:02","modified":"2015-09-08 10:18:02"},{"id":"146","content_id":"1108","type":"1","file_name":"1108-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from New York and Washington.pdf","description":"Perspectives from International Organizations in New York and Washington, D.C.

Although there was no unanimous opinion, many interviewees from various sectors in Brussels appeared to be sceptical about this potential scenario (there was a strong EU-US transatlantic space but weak relations with the South), while others claimed that the Atlantic Basin could be more interconnected, mainly in economic terms. GMF and FRIDE, with their respective offices used their networks to interview the relevant actors based on their professional and academic expertise. The main concerns regarding the current state and future of the Atlantic region included, amongst others: the future of the TTIP trade negotiation between the US and the EU, the lack of a cohesive &ldquo;Atlantic&rdquo; security approach, the struggle for a united and common energy and climate and environmental policy within the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from France <\/strong>(by Danielle Piatkiewicz and Bruno Medroa, GMF)<\/p>\r\n<p>The Atlantic Future project explores the concept that new relations are emerging in the Atlantic space beyond the traditional North Atlantic alliance and the North-South dependency. GMF, with their respective office in Paris, France, used their networks to interview the relevant actors based on their professional and academic expertise. The main consensus on the emergence of a pan- Atlantic space was mixed. The main concerns on the current and future state of the Atlantic region from the Paris perspective touched on the following;&nbsp; future of the trade and investment, along with the negotiation of free trade agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the U.S. and the EU. The respondents identified the need for different priorities between North and South Atlantic. It was strongly expressed that Europe and the U.S. remain the most important actors for the global economy, along with China and India. However, countries like Brazil or South Africa have been rising as economic models rather than as economic powers, and show an increased influence from the Southern Atlantic countries.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Portugal <\/strong>(by Daniel Marcos,IPRI-NOVA University)<\/p>\r\n<p>The creation of a pan-Atlantic space, based on cooperation between the different regions of the Atlantic is fundamental for the future of the Atlantic basin, capable to deal with the emergence of new powers in the Asia-Pacific Rim and the threats that emerged with the end of the Cold War: terrorism, migration trends, illicit trafficking, fragile states, etc. The analysis of four specific areas &ndash; economy and finances, security, people and institutions, resources and environment &ndash; has shown the existence of different stages of development of the Atlantic basin countries, mainly between the North and the South, which must be overcome by cooperation in these same areas. For Portuguese stakeholders, the European Union, African Union and NATO have a fundamental role to play, but EU is mostly seen as a role model to be followed for the development of regional and interregional cooperation. The challenge is to overcome the lack of leadership of EU in the last 5 years and the traditional suspicion of the South Atlantic regarding to the North in order to deepen the relations between the shores of the Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Spain <\/strong>(by Susanne Gratius, FRIDE)<\/p>\r\n<p>The perceptions and opinions of Spanish stakeholders on the Atlantic are highly diverse but coincide in the need to include Latin America in Transatlantic relations. Most interviewees in Spain focused on economic aspects and security interests in the Atlantic, while people and institutions, resources and environment ranked second. The overwhelming majority of interviewees shared a rather sceptical view on the future of the Atlantic as an articulated and institutionalized space or a community of values. There was also a consensus on the view that Latin America is part of the Atlantic identity, while Africa is more distant in terms of values and norms, development and common interest. The North-South divide is still present, but most interviewees agreed on the need for a more balanced and horizontal relationship taking into account the power shifts towards regional leaders like Brazil, Mexico or South Africa, on the one hand, and multinational companies and &ldquo;global civil society networks, on the other.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Germany&nbsp;<\/strong>(by Christoph H. Stefes,Ecologic Institute Berlin)<\/p>\r\n<p>The twenty individuals from Germany interviewed for this project emphasized the critical importance of transatlantic relations for Europe. Despite its relative decline in power, the United States is still considered Europe&rsquo;s most important security and economic partner. The interviewees accordingly emphasized the need to conclude the current TTIP negotiations successfully. The emergence of a pan-Atlantic community on the other hand met more scepticism, as interviewees pointed towards the still existing lack of consolidated liberal democracies and resilient markets in Latin America and even more so in Africa. Moreover, they perceived a lack of common values and shared interests across the regions of the South Atlantic and the regions of the North Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Italy&nbsp;<\/strong>(by Andrea Dess&igrave; and Chiara Rosselli,Istituto Affari Internazionali)<\/p>\r\n<p>On the whole sceptical about the notion of an emerging pan-Atlantic space, Italian stakeholders converged around the necessity of strengthening the transatlantic relationship as the primary means to ensure a continued relevance on the world stage and greater conformity to EU-US norms and standards among Atlantic countries. While impossible to ignore the rising influence of Asia and China in the Atlantic, Europe and the US maintain certain margins of influence and leverage within this space. Supportive of the TTIP, stakeholders emphasised Europe&rsquo;s internal divisions, a lack of trust and the persistence of paternalism in North-South relations as the primary obstacles for the emergence of closer cooperation among Atlantic countries.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Poland <\/strong>(by Corinna H\u04e7rst and Danielle Piatkiewicz,GMF)<\/p>\r\n<p>The concept of a new pan-Atlantic system of relations emerging in the Atlantic space beyond the traditional North Atlantic alliance and the North-South dependency has captured the Atlantic space. Polish interviewees from Warsaw viewed the idea with a measure of scepticism. Although there was no unanimous opinion, many interviewees from various sectors in Warsaw appeared to be sceptical about this potential scenario stating that the lack of a unified EU and Europe could prevent this idea from forming. The German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) and their Warsaw based office used their networks to interview the relevant actors based on their professional and academic expertise. The overall main concerns regarding the current state and future of the Atlantic region included, amongst others: the current and future state of transatlantic relations, the future of the TTIP trade negotiation between the US and the EU, the lack of a cohesive &ldquo;Atlantic&rdquo; security approach, the U.S.&rsquo;s shift towards other regions, and the lack of a cohesive energy and climate and environmental policy both within the EU and the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from the UK <\/strong>(by Sangeeta Khorana and Christina Stolte)<\/p>\r\n<p>Interviews in London informed us about the stakeholders&rsquo; perceptions in four thematic areas of the Atlantic Future project, which include: economy and finance, security, people and institutions, resources and environment. Main themes of focus were: changes over the past 20 years; drivers for change or continuity; prospective view of the changes and continuities in the region; actors and regional leaders (state or non-state level); relevance of the EU; perceptions on the evolution of the EU&rsquo;s role in the region over the past 20 years; and finally the convergence or divergence of norms within the Atlantic space. Based on the interview results in the UK, the paper reports that developments in the Atlantic have led to a proliferation of economic and non-economic initiatives amongst various Atlantic actors, both in the North and South. In the North, the North Atlantic community and the USA and EU is undergoing major changes in economic, security and political terms. Following the spectacular rise of Brazil and Africa, the focus has been gradually shifting from the EU and USA and new dynamics is evolving in the Atlantic space. However, a Pan Atlantic space is not really emerging but if the ongoing Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and USA were successful this could herald the beginning of a new Atlantic space. The EU is and continues to be an important player in the Atlantic, and is likely to play an influential role in the reconfiguration of the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from the Netherlands <\/strong>(by Lucy Olivia Smith,Ecologic Institute Berlin)<\/p>\r\n<p>Twenty individuals from the Netherlands were interviewed for this report on transatlantic geopolitics. While the North-Atlantic relationships between Europe and the US remains strong and established in issues related to security and economy, the project sought to gauge whether there was a budding pan-Atlantic community. Rather than confirm this idea, the interviewees highlighted the emergence of substantial emerging economies in Latin America and Africa and through this observation, emphasized the increasing polarity of the international community that is increasingly defined by diverse axis of power and significance and less so by traditional power blocs. While some specific topics had a distinctly Atlantic dimension, such as the issue of immigration and drug trafficking, most matters related to economy and security were firmly entrenched in the reality of a truly globalised world. When forming ideas of how Europe could maintain relevance, several interviewees saw the EU as a model for supra-national governance structures and demilitarisation and as defining itself in a soft power role.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the nine papers here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"166","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-10-07 07:55:00","modified":"2016-02-06 21:57:23"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"149","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-AF_WP7_ Deliverable 7.2.pdf","description":"Introduction","created":"2015-09-08 10:57:01","modified":"2015-09-08 10:57:01"},{"id":"150","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from Belgium_Brussels.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Brussels (by Elisa Lled\u00f3, FRIDE, and Danielle Piatkiewicz, GMF)","created":"2015-09-08 10:57:36","modified":"2015-09-08 10:57:36"},{"id":"151","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspecties from France_ Paris.pdf","description":"Perspectives from France (by Danielle Piatkiewicz and Bruno Medroa, GMF)","created":"2015-09-08 10:58:00","modified":"2015-09-08 10:58:00"},{"id":"152","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from Portugal.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Portugal (by Daniel Marcos, IPRI-NOVA University)","created":"2015-09-08 10:58:22","modified":"2015-09-08 10:58:22"},{"id":"153","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from Spain_ Madrid.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Spain (by Susanne Gratius, FRIDE)","created":"2015-09-08 10:59:03","modified":"2015-09-08 10:59:03"},{"id":"154","content_id":"1111","type":"1","file_name":"1111-ATLANTIC FUTURE_ Perspectives from Germany.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Germany (by Christoph H.

and perceptions on the Atlantic space across the American continent. The papers expose the results of interviews carried out in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia and Honduras, and US and Canada. &nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>","body":"<p><strong>Perspectives from Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela <\/strong>(In&ecirc;s Sousa, FGV &ndash; NPII)<\/p>\r\n<p>This paper explores the perspectives of Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela on the potential emergence of a pan-Atlantic system of relations beyond the North-North alliance and North South dependency. Interviews were conducted with specialists from various sectors in each of the aforementioned countries. We found a consensus on the perspective that increasing political and economic links between South America and Africa are being established. The increase in Chinese investments in South America and Africa is considered to be determinant to the on-going political and economic transformations taking place in the Atlantic basin.&nbsp; The role of EU is considered relevant, seen as a potential mediator and an actor able to somewhat balance US influence as well as Chinese presence in South America and Africa. Overall, a pan-Atlantic system of relations is not considered to be taking shape. All point out to the (political, social, economic, cultural&hellip;) differences found in the South Atlantic itself, as well as in relation to the North. The present findings should be considered by the EU when designing its external policies and initiatives involving Southern countries. It is our assessment that any venture that disregards the views observed during this research and summarized here would most likely not be successful.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Mexico, Colombia and Honduras<\/strong> (by Mark Aspinwall, Elsy Gonz&aacute;lez &amp; Lorena Ruano, CIDE)<\/p>\r\n<p>This paper reports on the findings of field interviews with elites in Mexico, Colombia, and Honduras. Interviewees were questioned on their views of the relevance of issues, partners, cooperation and conflict across the Atlantic space. Key topics mentioned repeatedly by interviewees across the three countries were migration, drug trafficking, and the importance of the USA as a global partner. In the area of security, all interviewees see the USA as the principal actor, with terrorism and fragile states as the main threats. In the environment, the thinking of interviewees was more global than regional, but all saw climate change as the main issue. In terms of trade and finance, liberalization and cooperation were the predominant lines of thinking, while in people and institutions, democratization and migration were key topics. Democracy, markets, and cooperation were seen as common values across the Atlantic. Prospects for cooperation would be improved if Northern states and regions paid more attention to the South, according to the interviewees, but there was also a significant current of opinion that Latin America (and more particularly, some of its main actors, like Brazil and Colombia) is emerging in its own right.&nbsp;Prospects for an Atlantic partnership seem slim, and there does not seem to be an automatic perception of the Atlantic as a relevant geopolitical concept, though there is no consensus on what is the most important obstacle. Some say it is cultural differences and government inconsistency and indifference, while others blame financing problems. Language, distance, transportation, infrastructure, poor management of aid funding, time zones, and culture were all mentioned. However, the regions of the Atlantic are seen as relevant units of study. Cooperation within Latin America was seen as valuable in order to prevent exploitation by the North. Notwithstanding this pessimism, in each of the three countries, two-thirds of elites say that an Atlantic Rim is taking shape. Public sector and academic officials are more likely to say yes, while private sector, media and NGO officials are more mixed. Likewise, opinion about the utility and benefits of Atlantic cooperation in all three states is very favorable, especially so in Honduras.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Perspectives from Canada and the United States&nbsp;<\/strong>(by Daniel S. Hamilton<strong>, <\/strong>Center for Transatlantic Relations, Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies)<\/p>\r\n<p>Canadian and American opinion leaders are aware of many changing dynamics affecting the countries and peoples of the broad Atlantic space, yet do not have a uniform view of what such changes mean for pan-Atlantic cooperation or the emergence of a broad ''Atlantic'' consciousness. Most believe that there will be greater cooperation in the Atlantic in the next 5 to 15 years, but also believe that informal networks are more likely to be effective that formal structures to facilitate such cooperation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the three papers here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"107","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-10-06 10:13:00","modified":"2016-02-06 15:01:26"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"142","content_id":"1107","type":"1","file_name":"1107-ATLANTIC FUTURE_WP7_Perspectives from Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela (In\u00eas Sousa, FGV \u2013 NPII) ","created":"2015-09-08 10:14:06","modified":"2015-09-08 10:14:06"},{"id":"143","content_id":"1107","type":"1","file_name":"1107-ATLANTIC FUTURE_WP7_Perspectives from Mexico, Colombia and Honduras.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Mexico, Colombia and Honduras (by Mark Aspinwall, Elsy Gonz\u00e1lez & Lorena Ruano, CIDE)","created":"2015-09-08 10:15:21","modified":"2015-09-08 10:15:21"},{"id":"144","content_id":"1107","type":"1","file_name":"1107-ATLANTIC FUTURE_WP7_Perspectives from Canada and the United States.pdf","description":"Perspectives from Canada and the United States (by Daniel S.

Covering representatives from various sectors in society, the analysed interviews reveal how divergence and convergence is perceived in terms of economics, institutions, energy and security. The findings reveal a very cautious approach to the idea of an Atlantic space. The priorities of political imaginations appear to be centred on national interests and on the rise of Asia in the global order, leaving very little excitement for a project with regions that are either seen as dominant (Europe and North America) or unknown (South America).

They show the multileveled complexity of the issues at hand and the near absence of a vision of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, emergent initiatives are not counteracting an Atlantic will.

Most interviewees perceived a pan-Atlantic space taking shape or at least they expressed their desire that it could emerge would be happening. They saw a movement towards cooperation especially in economics and security. Many suggestions were made on how to stimulate the creation of a pan-Atlantic space by those who did not forseen a pan-Atlantic taking shape yet or whom believed it is still a very insignificant

manifold and mutually reinforcing. This paper examines the dynamics of four key environment and resources issues, looking to the 2020\/2025 horizon: climate mitigation and energy transformations; food security; overfishing; and wildlife trafficking and biodiversity loss. Each is global in nature, yet Atlantic actors play influential roles and have shared interests in, and critical resources for, addressing them. Underlying these challenges are regional and global drivers of resource consumption and production. Rising demand for resources to feed growing and wealthier populations is shifting global production and consumption patterns, and in turn, creating heavy environmental strain. Where policy solutions prove insufficient to internalize costs, economic interests will continue to drive unsustainable, and often illegal, resource use and consumption. Nevertheless, despite negative trajectories in many areas, the Atlantic Space offers unique opportunities for concerted action and furthering networks of state and non-state actors to address the environmental challenges of today and of the future through coordinated regional action.<\/p>","views":"251","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-09-11 17:08:00","modified":"2016-01-31 22:41:04"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"163","content_id":"1113","type":"1","file_name":"1113-WP9_Ecologic_Patterns of Production and Consumption in the Atlantic Space and Future Environment and Resource Scenarios.pdf","description":"Patterns of Production and Consumption in the Atlantic Space and Future Environment and Resource Scenarios","created":"2015-09-10 17:20:20","modified":"2015-09-10 17:20:20"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"6351","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"6344","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"162","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"162","code":"resources","name":"resources","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"6345","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"107","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"107","code":"climate-change","name":"Climate change","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:29","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:29"}},{"id":"6346","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"108","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"108","code":"energy","name":"Energy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:45","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:45"}},{"id":"6347","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"163","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"163","code":"food-security","name":"food security","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"6348","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"211","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"211","code":"illicit-trafficking","name":"illicit trafficking","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"6349","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"109","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"109","code":"environment","name":"Environment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:06:53","modified":"2013-09-27 11:06:53"}},{"id":"6350","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"242","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"242","code":"food-production","name":"food production","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"6351","content_id":"1113","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"1115","code":"atlantics-emerging-security-challenges","user_id":"1","title":"Atlantic\u2019s Emerging Security Challenges","abstract":"<p>In much contrast to the territorial disputes and military tensions defining the Pacific Rim, the Atlantic remains a relatively stable geo-political sphere, largely due to the lack of great power conflict.

Do you agree with this statement?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In your view, what other forms of regional integration can be boosted in order to integrate new non-state actors that are shaping the inter-regional relations in the Atlantic?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>During the Atlantic Future research we found that there was an impression that emerging regional blocs in South America and Africa were actually pivoted towards Asia. E.g. Pacific Alliance and Eastern Africa. Would you say that is true?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>South American countries, such as Brazil emphasize the fact that the South Atlantic dynamics are very different from the North Atlantic. Some of these countries are very skeptic about NATO&rsquo;s presence in their surrounding waters. Considering that, do you envisage any kind of cooperation\/interaction between organizations such as the ZOPACAS and Unasur and NATO in the near future?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>This webinar was jointly organised by CIDOB and Ecologic Institute.<\/p>","views":"74","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-06-29 10:49:31","modified":"2016-02-05 09:25:56"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"5505","content_id":"944","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"5501","content_id":"944","tag_id":"155","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"155","code":"regionalism","name":"Regionalism","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-01-10 12:59:30","modified":"2014-01-10 12:59:30"}},{"id":"5502","content_id":"944","tag_id":"141","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"141","code":"latin-america","name":"Latin America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:43","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:43"}},{"id":"5503","content_id":"944","tag_id":"138","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"138","code":"europe","name":"Europe","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:16:35","modified":"2013-10-25 10:16:35"}},{"id":"5504","content_id":"944","tag_id":"140","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"5505","content_id":"944","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"904","code":"webinar-regionalisms-across-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"WEBINAR: REGIONALISMS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC","abstract":"<p>ATLANTIC FUTURE is pleased to invite you to a webinar &ldquo;<strong>Regionalisms across the Atlantic: divergences and convergences&rdquo;<\/strong>, to be conducted by&nbsp;<strong>Frank Mattheis<\/strong>, Senior Researcher at the Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation at the University of Pretoria, and <strong>Andr&eacute;s Malamud<\/strong>,Research Fellow at the Institute of Social Sciences (ICS) of the University of Lisbon, as discussant.<\/p>","body":"<p>The prevalence of national and global interactions notwithstanding, regions have established themselves as a crucial space in international relations.&nbsp; In addition, regions are also emerging as actors in their own right.

The seminar, entitled &ldquo;<strong>The Future of the Atlantic: Common dynamics or different paths?<\/strong>&rdquo;was held in the margins of the ATLANTIC FUTURE Plenary Meeting in Lisbon and aimed to discuss the present and the future of the Atlantic basin taking into account the transformations that we have assisted in the last twenty years. While the relations between the North America and Europe remained very strong, we are witnessing a strong growth of Africa and Latin America. Their weight in the international system has grown in relevance in areas such as economy, energy, security, human and institutional development and environment. In the meantime, we are observing a tremendous growth in Asia-Pacific area and with emerging powers like China becoming relevant actors in the Atlantic space.<\/p>","body":"<p>The Lunch Seminar sought to reinforce the interest of postgraduate students from universities in Lisbon (Institute of Social Sciences &ndash; University of Lisbon; Institute of Social and an Political Sciences &ndash; University of Lisbon; Institute for Political Studies of the Catholic University; School of Social and Human Sciences of the NOVA University of Lisbon; University Institute of Lisbon) working already in the Atlantic to deepen their research interests on the topic. Chaired by Daniel Marcos from IPRI-NOVA, the seminar begun with his remarks on the importance of the Atlantic and then gave the floor to three experts: Victor Borges, Former Cape Verde Foreign Minister; Dorval Brunelle, Professor at the University of Quebec in Montreal and Carlos Gaspar, member of the board of the IPRI-NOVA and Professor at the NOVA University of Lisbon.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Victor Borges presentation focused on four main ideas: 1) recognizing the existence of different interests and perspectives in the Atlantic; 2) setting the grounds for the discussion of the Atlantic; 3) building up common concerns; and 4) working together (States, regional and inter-regional entities and even international institutions, like the UN through the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea). According to him, to develop a better future it is necessary to take into account the past and to understand the present. Focusing on the features of the past, he spoke of the economic supremacy of the North, the European expeditions, the slavery and natural resources exploitation that had a huge impact on the North-South relations. Regarding the present, today&rsquo;s profound development divide is also important - too much dependency and poverty in the South while the North has some sort of convergence; and the political, economic, territorial and military presence of North powers in the South. But despite obvious strategic differences, Victor Borges defended that there is space to harmonize the relation between the North and the South with common grounds and cooperation, focusing on national and regional security, human security, economics, trade, energy supply, food security, maritime protection, drug trafficking and other illegal activities. Later, he defended that to understand which players should build a common future it is important to take into account institutional players like states, but also regional entities and non-institutional players. This will lead to a wide Atlantic area with peace, security, stability and acceptable governance, common values and legality instead of power, and regional and interregional coordination.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/847-1430814260.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Dorval Brunelle started his presentation by setting the grounds for the Atlantic Future project, to &ldquo;where did it came and where it will go?&rdquo;, warning of the problems of a state centric approach of the future of the Atlantic or the limitations of the international level analysis. He highlighted the relevance of the local level analysis, focusing on the pollution, fishermen, oil rigs, the users of the ocean and that have a huge impact in the Atlantic. Focusing on the conceptual tools, he identified cities as very important actors. The problems of the Atlantic are happening at local level. Dorval Brunelle believes that two opposing trends are happening in the ocean space: the &ldquo;maritimisation of territory&rdquo; and a &ldquo;territorialisation of maritime space&rdquo;. The first one focusing on the security of maritime lines, the supply by sea routes and sea transport is much cheaper than by land &ndash; the water doesn&rsquo;t cost anything. The second focuses on the conflicting claims the seas have been object of. The land and ocean space share common grounds so it is important to construct a new way to see the interface between ocean and land, to limit the misuse of the ocean. Finally, to rethink the Atlantic he believes that it is important to include the geographers, develop new programmes that do not jump from the local to the regional and international level and that can give us new ways to see the sea.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/847-1430814653.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>At the end, Carlos Gaspar raised the question about the Atlantic being an autonomous entity in international politics. According to him, it can be seen as 1) an organized system, a &ldquo;region of regions&rdquo; with no regional conflict among regional great powers; 2) a democratic system &ndash; all four regions are led by democratic powers and a great majority of the regions member states are pluralist democracies; 3) with relevant historical and cultural convergence between all regions of the Atlantic. All of this allows common dynamics leading to the peaceful convergence of the main regional actors. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that the Atlantic constitute a regional entity. The factors that are at the basis of the North Atlantic alliance differ from those that shaped the relation between the rest of the Atlantic and the convergence common to the four regions cannot be taken for granted: it works to balance the expansion of Asia and to face the escalation of conflicts between the major powers in the Indo-Pacific system, defining itself as a pole of stability in the international system.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>After this, the lunch was served, during which the students exchanged views with the speakers and with the partners of the ATLANTIC FUTURE.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"261","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-05-05 09:41:00","modified":"2016-02-08 16:44:16"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"5261","content_id":"847","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"5255","content_id":"847","tag_id":"246","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"246","code":"lisbon","name":"lisbon","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"5256","content_id":"847","tag_id":"54","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"54","code":"perspectives","name":"Perspectives","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:43:59","modified":"2013-09-27 10:43:59"}},{"id":"5257","content_id":"847","tag_id":"147","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"147","code":"international-relations","name":"international relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-11-18 11:32:59","modified":"2013-11-18 11:32:59"}},{"id":"5258","content_id":"847","tag_id":"5","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"5","code":"atlantic-space","name":"Atlantic space","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:55:08","modified":"2013-09-27 09:55:08"}},{"id":"5259","content_id":"847","tag_id":"15","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"5260","content_id":"847","tag_id":"53","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"53","code":"north-atlantic","name":"North Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:53:35","modified":"2013-09-27 11:53:35"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"5261","content_id":"847","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"837","code":"public-event-in-lisbon","user_id":"1","title":"Public event in Lisbon","abstract":"<p>The ATLANTIC FUTURE third plenary meeting was held in Lisboa, Portugal, on 22-24 April 2015 and hosted by IPRI-NOVA.&nbsp;The meeting started with a public event on &ldquo;Setting the Grounds for a New Understanding of the Atlantic&rdquo;.

Teixeira opened the floor by welcoming the assistants and by presenting the speakers. He then spoke of the Atlantic by referring how the end of the Cold War accelerated democratisation in the Atlantic. As a result, there is a new homogeneity in the interaction between US, Brazil, Europe, Africa and Latin America. There is recognition of common interests in international security issues, an increase in economic exchange, and growing linkages in several areas. Overall, there is more interaction in the broad Atlantic area.<\/p>\r\n<p>He wondered what the challenges of the future are. These changes need to be institutionally and politically translated in order to create and Atlantic community. The Atlantic continues to benefit from a certain institutionalisation of the Atlantic relations. But in the South, emerging powers adopt a strategy of greater autonomy. In the long term, this may be beneficial to other areas, namely to Asia (China). The South Atlantic has emerged as an area of economic prosperity and energy production (Brazil, Nigeria, and Angola, among others). There is a diversification of the type of relations in the Atlantic, not only the traditional North-South but also new relations South-South in which Brazil has been playing a very important role. We are seeing the emergence of a new pan-Atlantic system of relations in the Atlantic Basin, far beyond the two traditional relations in the Atlantic: the alliance between Europe and the US and the traditional dependence North-South. &nbsp;However, according to Nuno S. Teixeira, a new pan-Atlantic system of relations is a vision, but it is a vision without a strategy. It is a vision without the instruments of multilateral institutionalisation of the system of these new relations. Something that is absolutely fundamental for future cooperation. According to him, this is the main challenge we face today and our aim with this project is to try to contribute to this vision and to this strategy, trying to build an Atlantic unity for the future.<\/p>\r\n<p>Jordi Bacaria presented the Atlantic Future project, highlighting the European Commission funding and support in the research. Jordi Bacaria overviewed the project with the main outputs and the work ahead. He placed the project and the Atlantic in the context of latest developments such as the negotiations of the TTIP or the creation of the Development Bank.<\/p>\r\n<p>Dan Hamilton started his intervention by pointing that there is a lot more going on in the Atlantic space that is generally understood. Globalisation is not limited to the Pacific. Most of the media and political discourse seems to conflate what is going on in Asia (mainly China) with globalisation. Hamilton clarified that both are much related, but globalisation does not only happen in China. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>To support his statement he highlighted a few key areas. The Atlantic provides as much energy to the world as the Middle East, and the trends in the Atlantic are much more dynamic. In trade, the Atlantic is still where most trade takes place. Trade and goods are still very strong in the North Atlantic, and also between South American and Europe and South America and North America. South-South exchanges are still the weakest, though it is true that these are the most dynamic. Demand is going to find a new way, and ports are scrambling to take on big tankers. An example of that, Dan Hamilton, mentioned how &nbsp;Houston-Texas, has become the largest city export in the US. &ldquo;People in Texas think they are Atlantic&rdquo;, said Hamilton. Trade in goods is getting increasingly Pacific; however, services are a more Atlantic phenomenon, especially in the North Atlantic, and investment is still an Atlantic phenomenon. Finally, Dan Hamilton added that the expansion of the Panama Canal and the melting of the Arctic are creating new transportation passages.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/837-1430296596.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Albeit these are the most prominent areas, Dan Hamilton considered that other areas are &nbsp;also worth exploring: 1) the Atlantic Ocean, as there are issues that are specific to the Atlantic Ocean. Globalisation dynamics are creating all sorts of new challenges such as rising sea levels in the Atlantic coast faster than anywhere else, pollution, overfishing where no regimes to take care for the full Atlantic, with no governance structures, among many others; 2) Maritime securities; and 3) Challenges to human security. He further referred to values in the Atlantic. In his view, there is no contestation of values in the region, as most people in the Atlantic agree and aspire to the same values. Although this does not mean that these are achieved, there is a common type of orientation. In the Pacific, on the contrary, there is much more contestation of values.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">Thus the Atlantic becomes a laboratory. The Atlantic does not have the cleavages of the Pacific, so there is an opportunity to be a laboratory of governance. Beyond the North-South line, the Atlantic could pave the way and could be a pioneer. This is far beyond where we are today. It is true that disintegrative trends are there but, according to Dan Hamilton, opportunities are here as well. &nbsp;The Atlantic is half of the world. Therefore, if there is an Asian hemisphere, there is also an Atlantic hemisphere. We think of ocean basins, and the connections that those oceans create are a new way of thinking. Hamilton warned that disintegrative trends are the easiest to take us forward. The Atlantic, however, would be poor if we let these tendencies win. This is where the real battle is.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>After the speakers&rsquo; presentation, an interesting debate ensued with the audience. On the United States pivot to the Pacific, Dan Hamilton wondered why the US could not use both vocations: the Atlantic and the Pacific ones. The same happens with Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and all South America. He said that the US is the pivot. It is still so despite relative decline. So from a purely US point of view, the US should enhance the position in the Pacific and also look at the Atlantic. The US has failed to become an Atlantic power and it is instead a North Atlantic power. For Dan Hamilton, the US should reposition itself in this world of diffuse power more pan-Atlantic than in the Pacific. From a security perspective, Dan Hamilton added that the correlation between societal developments, illicit traffic of drugs, humans and weapons with fragile states structure is one of the global challenges of the region -especially in Africa and Latin America. Therefore, he added that transposing institutions for part of the Atlantic Southward is not the way to go.<\/p>\r\n<p>He was asked on legacies in the Atlantic. Victor Borges reflected how there are common features in the Atlantic such as languages or culture, and yet there are also negative things that are still lingering and that reverberates in the present. If these are not managed correctly, these will shape the future. We can see a big picture of homogeneous Atlantic, but we need to go deeper to see the details that can make the difference. The problem is who is going to lead. Whose perspective is going to be placed in the middle to develop this new wider Atlantic? To this reflection, Dan Hamilton added that certainly in the Atlantic we have to deal with legacies. But, he said, continuing in the same mould does not allow us to get beyond this type of thinking. If it is not managed in the right way it is going to backfire us. There is ample opportunity of new infrastructure, there are new things happening and some pioneering work could be done.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/837-1430296475.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Hamilton said that the idea of the Atlantic space will not succeed if it is not shared by people in Brazil, in Africa, etc. It has to be driven &ldquo;by Southern demand&rdquo;, he added. The bigger efforts are in the South more than in the North for this reason. Can we get out of the North-South boxes, even from the BRICS boxes? The Atlantic frame could be a new window to overcome the North\/South way of seeing things, as the traditional frame will no longer work.<\/p>\r\n<p>Asked on the extent to which current and future trade relations will impact on the Atlantic, particularly on the TTIP and its potential disruptive power, seen as the North trying again to exert a leading role, Dan Hamilton pointed that the TTIP is not happening in isolation. A TPP is also being negotiated. He referred to TTIP as another effort to spring loose the multilateral system in another way. By advancing in these areas, it is an assertive effort by US and EU that should work for everyone. The question is whether it is open: leaders have not said that this is open to others, and this is the mistake. They have said it in the Pacific, but not for the TTIP. It is about the norms, standards, rules, that will guide us into the future, he added.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hamilton referred to the importance of a non-governmental approach. In the world we face, the public-private network is more relevant than state to state. Despite differences, he said, things can be done. Years ago people looked at Pacific and thought that something could be done, and as a result nowadays APEC exists. The Pacific is a much more diverse region with greater challenges than the Atlantic. There could be different forms of collaboration in the Atlantic. Networks become the more relevant angle to look at some of the current challenges. There is an opportunity to explore.<\/p>\r\n<p>Jordi Bacaria finished by adding that the Atlantic Future project itself tries to build epistemic communities. He reflected on the fact that if all projects are born in the North, we will have a Northern perspective. We need to have more projects in the South, he said. Otherwise, the perspective will always be North Atlantic. Nevertheless, he also pointed out that this is changing.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>After the public debate, the seminar continued with a roundtable with Maria Raquel Freire (University of Coimbra), Tiago Moreira de S&aacute; and Emanuel Joaquim (IPRI). The experts presented their research on Russian foreign policy and on the US and the Azores, and elaborated on the implications for the Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/837-1430296622.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>","views":"297","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-04-29 10:24:00","modified":"2016-02-08 04:24:10"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"130","content_id":"837","type":"1","file_name":"837-Lisboa_Setting the Grounds_public event.pdf","description":"Public event report","created":"2015-04-29 10:25:35","modified":"2015-04-29 10:25:35"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"5246","content_id":"837","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"5240","content_id":"837","tag_id":"108","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"108","code":"energy","name":"Energy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:45","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:45"}},{"id":"5241","content_id":"837","tag_id":"16","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"5242","content_id":"837","tag_id":"187","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"187","code":"transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership","name":"transatlantic trade and investment partnership","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"5243","content_id":"837","tag_id":"186","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"186","code":"ttip","name":"ttip","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"5244","content_id":"837","tag_id":"2","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"2","code":"laboratory","name":"Laboratory","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:04:01","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:01"}},{"id":"5245","content_id":"837","tag_id":"6","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"6","code":"globalisation","name":"Globalisation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:03:52","modified":"2013-09-27 10:03:52"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"5246","content_id":"837","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"763","code":"webinar-ttip-and-the-wider-atlantic-1","user_id":"1","title":"WEBINAR: TTIP AND THE WIDER ATLANTIC ","abstract":"<p>The first Atlantic Future webinar explored&nbsp;the potential impact of the TTIP on the four shores of the wider Atlantic Space.<\/p>","body":"<p>The first Atlantic Future webinar on &ldquo;TTIP and the Wider Atlantic&rdquo; took place on 15 April.

An interview with Jordi Vaquer i Fan&eacute;s, Director of the Open Society Initiative for Europe and Associate Senior Researcher of CIDOB.<\/p>","body":"<p><em>Jordi Vaquer is the director of the Open Society Initiative for Europe and the regional director for Europe at the Open Society Foundations. In these positions, he works to advance the values and institutions of open society in the cities and countries of the European Union and the Western Balkans. Vaquer writes and provides commentary for Spanish media, and often speaks at international debates and seminars on international affairs and EU politics. Before becoming director of the Open Society Initiative for Europe, Vaquer was director of the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs, one of southern Europe&rsquo;s most influential international relations think tanks and Coordinator of the Atlantic Future project. Vaquer graduated from the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain; received an MA from the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium; and completed a PhD in international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What does the ATLANTIC FUTURE project refer to with the expression &lsquo;Atlantic Space&rsquo;? Why should we think about the Atlantic in those terms?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A:&nbsp; The research focus of the Atlantic Future project is not self-evident. The Atlantic is an ocean, not an integrated region in any re&shy;cognizable shape; and it is not where the fo&shy;cus of international relations is, by contrast with the Arctic, the Indian Ocean and, above all, the Pacific. And yet, the space where Afri&shy;ca, the Americas and Europe meet remains one of crucial importance for Global Gover&shy;nance. The Atlantic perhaps exemplifies North\/South dynamics better than any other macro-region. It contains many of the difficulties and challenges of Global Governance; but, to address them, it can build on historical, cultural, linguistic and ideological links that cannot be compa&shy;red to those in any other Ocean basin. The weight of its past is an obstacle, but can also serve as a launching pad for future cooperation. And all Atlantic powers (from the US, the EU and Brazil, to the small littoral states of West Africa and the Caribbean) have an interest in not seeing the Atlantic become a backwater of global trade, and in maximizing the hitherto overlooked potential of their Atlantic links. These are all good reasons to take a serious, in depth look at the Atlantic space as an interlinked whole.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;To think about an Atlantic space is neither an exercise in wishful thinking, nor a nor&shy;mative endeavour. Atlantic Future as an intellectual project is an invi&shy;tation to lateral thinking and unusual re&shy;search, to take the less beaten track and ask the unexpected questions, to highlight the almost invisible connections and interpret the emerging trends. The research is teaching us about the four continents that border it, and about their links; at the same time, we are learning about Globalization, and the results may point towards possible roads to better global governance.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Which do you consider to be the trends that could shape the emergence of an Atlantic Space?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: The global redistribution of power affects the Atlantic space as much as any other part of the World. The emergence of the South holds the promise of a radical re-equilibrium for the whole Atlantic, with new opportunities for growth and exchange in all directions and, potentially, plenty of space for win-win situations. The pivot of the gravity centre of global geoeconomics towards Asia, on the contrary, represents a challenge to a space that was, for a long time, at the centre of Globalisation. Another trend is the emergence of new forms of regionalism in Africa and Latin America, less shaped by the EU model, and in a context where countries are rapidly abandoning old, post-colonial dependency relationships and developing multi-vector strategies (towards North America and Europe, but also towards East Asia, South Asia, inside the regions themselves, and across the southern Atlantic).<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: Which areas for potential regional cooperation do you envisage for the Atlantic?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>A: &nbsp;The three areas with most potential for cooperation that I see are security, food production and environmental governance. In the area of security, the Atlantic space has a number of grey spaces &ndash; whether it is fragile states like Haiti and Guinea Bissau, weak states like Mauritania and Honduras that struggle to control violent groups, or even black holes of insecurity inside relatively large and powerful countries such as Mexico and Nigeria &ndash; where different kinds of mostly unconventional security risks (terrorism, drug traffic, violent crime and piracy) flourish. In food production, the Atlantic regions combined (the Americas, Africa and Europe) hold the key to addressing food security at global scale, but they have to find the ways to do it without intolerable ecologic impact. Finally, environmental governance is an urgent issue that cannot be delayed. From the preservation of fisheries to climate change, from biodiversity to chemical pollution of the oceans, the Atlantic could pioneer the solutions to a range of environmental issues.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"154","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"1","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-03-13 12:12:00","modified":"2016-02-07 19:01:30"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"116","content_id":"481","type":"1","file_name":"481-ATLANTIC VOICES_01.pdf","description":"Atlantic Voices.

Entitled&nbsp;&ldquo;The Atlantic: Drivers of Change&rdquo;, the event took place within a three-year collaborative research project funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme, entitled &ldquo;Towards an Atlantic area? Mapping trends, perspectives and interregional dynamics between Europe, Africa and the Americas.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>","body":"<p>The discussion kicked&nbsp;off with short presentations on new research findings which analyzed&nbsp;the changes occurring in the Atlantic basin with respect to energy, maritime security, and economic governance. It was argued that there is a high degree of fragmentation within the Atlantic space due to the&nbsp;growing importance of new actors and agendas. While opportunities and challenges exist when it comes to regional cooperation, there was a general consensus that there is a need for integrated&nbsp;policy strategies.<\/p>\r\n<p>Countries along the Atlantic basin have strong bases for&nbsp;cooperation -&nbsp;including language, democratic institutions, and cultural proximity -&nbsp;which are all driving factors for cooperation in the Atlantic. It was noted that a new era of energy may be found in the pan-Atlantic space, as it has the potential to drive the future of energy with its large capacity vis-&agrave;-vis renewable energy. With the expansion of new energy infrastructures in the pan-Atlantic space, this could also lead to market development as it has already caught the attention of Chinese and Indian investments.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>On maritime security, the discussion highlighted key&nbsp;threats; drug trafficking, organised crime, and piracy, all of&nbsp;which are becoming increasingly interlinked. Governments in both the South and the&nbsp;North see these threats as obstacles for cooperation but have not been able to adequately address the threat, which also carries economic costs for surrounding countries. Therefore,&nbsp;importance of cooperation to cope with maritime security issues was stressed.<\/p>\r\n<p>The discussion concluded with a discussion on the impact of the pending Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which was seen as vital in &nbsp;respect to the way the world is developing. Concerns were also raised about Europe and the U.S. becoming global economic leaders and to what degree they would provide a regulatory framework for others to follow &ndash; or whether some countries may be excluded.<\/p>\r\n<p><a

We will examine the proliferations of trade agreements in the Atlantic, &ldquo;barriers&rdquo; or &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo; for new models of governance in the region, and finally what the role of the European Union in the Atlantic region should&nbsp;be.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Please confirm your attendance to <a href=\"mailto:bmedroa@gmfus.org\">bmedroa@gmfus.org<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/463-1424259344.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme under the grant agreement n&deg; [320091].<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/463-1424353239.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/463-1424353259.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/463-1424353325.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/463-1424353650.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 21.9200000762939px;\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/463-1424353854.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"211","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"1","created":"2015-02-24 10:00:00","modified":"2016-02-06 16:07:05"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":"463","datetime":"2015-02-24 10:00:00","country":"Belgium","city":"Brussels","address":"","map":""},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"5026","content_id":"463","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"5021","content_id":"463","tag_id":"137","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"137","code":"european-union","name":"European Union","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:16:06","modified":"2013-10-25 10:16:06"}},{"id":"5022","content_id":"463","tag_id":"5","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"5","code":"atlantic-space","name":"Atlantic space","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:55:08","modified":"2013-09-27 09:55:08"}},{"id":"5023","content_id":"463","tag_id":"24","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"24","code":"political-relations","name":"Political relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:04:54","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:54"}},{"id":"5024","content_id":"463","tag_id":"147","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"147","code":"international-relations","name":"international relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-11-18 11:32:59","modified":"2013-11-18 11:32:59"}},{"id":"5025","content_id":"463","tag_id":"36","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"36","code":"events","name":"Events","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"995B31","created":"2013-09-27 09:58:37","modified":"2013-09-27 09:58:37"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"5026","content_id":"463","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"450","code":"atlantic-future-seminar-in-rio-de-janeiro","user_id":"1","title":"Atlantic Future Seminar in Rio de Janeiro","abstract":"<p><strong>The second plenary meeting of the ATLANTIC FUTURE project was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 22 to 24 October 2014. Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Get&uacute;lio Vargas (FGV) hosted it and representatives of the entire consortium attended to the event. The first day of the meeting consisted of a public event about security issues in the Atlantic region that was held at the Auditorium Engenheiro M. F. Thompson Motta of the Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Get&uacute;lio Vargas headquarters.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>","body":"<p>The public seminar was opened by <strong>Mr. Carlos Iven Simonsen Leal<\/strong>, President of the Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Get&uacute;lio Vargas, who welcomed the participants and started the seminar by analysing the strategic importance of the Atlantic area and its relationship with international actors such as Asia, the United States of America and the European Union.<\/p>\r\n<p>After that, <strong>Mr. Jordi Bacaria<\/strong>, Director of the Barcelona Centre for Foreign Affairs (CIDOB) explained to the audience the objectives of the ATLANTIC FUTURE project, its achievements during the first period of the project, the future challenges that lay ahead and how global changes are shaping the strategic movements in the region.<\/p>\r\n<p>The seminar continued with a presentation by <strong>Admiral &Aacute;lvaro Augusto Dias Monteiro<\/strong>, President of the Council of the Centre of Political-Strategic Studies of the Brazilian Naval War College, who explained which is the Brazilian Navy's approach to the strategic challenges in the Atlantic area. During his intervention the Admiral mentioned that Brazil has a lack of sources of power which makes necessary to prioritize the strategic way to withstand to traditional and non-traditional threats (maritime crime, rivalry of resources, etc.) that have an impact on the Atlantic sea. According to him, the international security context in which the Atlantic interconnections are developing have induced the Brazilian Navy to think and act in terms of dissuasion by denial or punishment as a way to face the conventional or non-conventional threats that makes the Atlantic Sea a strategically area for the country. Up to the point that the Brazilian Navy has decided to invest in the construction of the Nuclear Submarine for the Brazilian Navy.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Admiral's presentation was followed by three sessions dedicated to the analysis of the &ldquo;the global security order and its impact on the Atlantic regional dynamics&rdquo;, &ldquo;the view of the Atlantic Basin as a security area&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Atlantic security as a path to development&rdquo;. These sessions counted with the participation of different partners of the project and some of them were chaired by special invitees such as the Brazilian Captain Alves de Almeida and Victor Borges (member of the Atlantic Future Scientific Panel). Finally, the seminar closed with a roundtable where participants shared views about how the Atlantic has been changing in terms of past alliances and future prospects for the region.<\/p>\r\n<p>Check photos of the Second Plenary Meeting below:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422438518.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422438592.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 21.9200000762939px;\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422438893.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422438963.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422439389.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422439991.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 21.9200000762939px;\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/450-1422440031.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">Watch the morning sessions:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-video-container\"><span class=\"pusher\">.<\/span><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yQh10rCpMno?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">Watch the afternoon sessions:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-video-container\"><span class=\"pusher\">.<\/span><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/C6YuC9Exww0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><span class=\"pusher\" style=\"display: inline !important;\">Download the Plenary Meeting&nbsp;report here:<\/span><\/p>","views":"289","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2015-01-28 10:45:00","modified":"2016-02-08 08:40:18"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"106","content_id":"450","type":"1","file_name":"450-Atlantic Future Project.

The technological revolutions in &lsquo;unconventional&rsquo; and &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; hydrocarbons &ndash; in shale and offshore &ndash; have recently contributed to a shift in the global center of gravity of energy supply away from the &lsquo;Great Crescent&rsquo; and into the &lsquo;Atlantic Basin.&rsquo; Combined with the shift in the global center of gravity for demand to emerging Asia-Pacific, these &lsquo;revolutions&rsquo; are reversing the traditional &lsquo;westward&rsquo; flow of energy from Eurasia to the Atlantic to produce a new pattern of global flows in which the countries of the Atlantic Basin will increasingly become the net suppliers of energy at the margin to Asia-Pacific. Furthermore, such &lsquo;revolutions&rsquo; have also played a role in the recent reversal of fortunes of renewable energy, particularly in the Northern Atlantic. Therefore, while shifting energy flow map &ndash; largely driven by the Atlantic energy renaissance &ndash; both calls into question the notion of the &lsquo;Asian century&rsquo; and problematizes the rationale behind the US &lsquo;pivot to Asia,&rsquo; it also reveals new geopolitical and governance potential along the strategic horizon for Atlantic actors. However, such potential&nbsp;will remain unrealized without &lsquo;pan-Atlantic energy cooperation that addresses both the emerging issues of the new &lsquo;energy seascape&rsquo; and the low carbon &lsquo;imperative.&rsquo; Finally, the &lsquo;Atlantic energy renaissance&rsquo; and the changing global energy flow map of which it is both cause and effect, also highlights the growing relative strategic significance of the &lsquo;Southern Atlantic&rsquo;.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"1090","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 15:06:00","modified":"2016-02-08 16:04:31"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"77","content_id":"338","type":"1","file_name":"338-ATLANTIC FUTURE_17_Energy.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 17: \u201cAtlantic Energy and the Changing Global Energy Flow Map\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 15:08:02","modified":"2014-09-29 15:08:02"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4101","content_id":"338","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"4094","content_id":"338","tag_id":"108","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"108","code":"energy","name":"Energy","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:45","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:45"}},{"id":"4095","content_id":"338","tag_id":"162","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"162","code":"resources","name":"resources","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4096","content_id":"338","tag_id":"1","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"1","code":"atlantic-basin","name":"Atlantic Basin","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:54:32","modified":"2013-09-27 09:54:32"}},{"id":"4097","content_id":"338","tag_id":"126","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"126","code":"cooperation","name":"Cooperation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:21:56","modified":"2013-09-30 10:21:56"}},{"id":"4098","content_id":"338","tag_id":"125","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"125","code":"johns-hopkins-university-jhu","name":"Johns Hopkins University (JHU)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:19:12","modified":"2013-09-30 10:19:12"}},{"id":"4099","content_id":"338","tag_id":"15","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"4100","content_id":"338","tag_id":"150","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4101","content_id":"338","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"337","code":"climate-change-impacts-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Climate change impacts in the Atlantic","abstract":"<blockquote><strong>[Photo Credit: Reuters File Photo]<\/strong><\/blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 16 is out: \"<\/strong><strong>Climate change impacts in the Atlantic Basin and coordinated adaptation responses<\/strong><strong>\", by <\/strong><strong>Christoph Stefes, Andrew Reid, Lucy Smith, and Elizabeth Tedsen<\/strong><strong> at&nbsp;<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ecologic.eu\/\">Ecologic Institute<\/a><\/p>","body":"<p>The need for ambitious implementation of strategies and measures for climate adaptation has become clear, however, at a global level, it is uncertain if or whether the issue is best confronted by centralised or fragmented structures of adaptation governance. This paper, an output of the EU ATLANTIC FUTURE project, investigates the dynamic network of transnational climate adaptation institutions currently working in the Atlantic Basin region. From a broad pool of adaptation institutions present in the Atlantic, eight case studies were selected and investigated, together representing an array of regions, forms of cooperation, actors, and thematic issues. Through case study analysis, this paper considers whether the work undertaken by these institutions is uniquely &lsquo;Atlantic&rsquo; in nature &ndash; that is, if and how they are driven, facilitated, or bounded by the specific actors, climate impacts, or characteristics of the region &ndash; or whether they are more global in nature. Secondly, we examine how these institutions fit within the larger picture of fragmented global climate adaptation governance. In doing so, we find indications that the Atlantic hosts and fosters a diverse and active array of institutions, but that these are largely focused on the production and exchange of scientific knowledge and capacity building, rather than on the implementation of concrete measures. Although the fragmented governance structure currently in place has produced much valuable work, increased centralisation could be beneficial for ensuring better coordination and implementation of adaptation activities at the ground level.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"630","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 15:03:00","modified":"2016-02-07 05:16:14"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"76","content_id":"337","type":"1","file_name":"337-ATLANTIC FUTURE_16_Climate change impacts in the Atlantic Basin.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 16: \u201cClimate change impacts in the Atlantic Basin and coordinated adaptation responses\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 15:03:30","modified":"2014-09-29 15:03:30"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4398","content_id":"337","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"4393","content_id":"337","tag_id":"107","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"107","code":"climate-change","name":"Climate change","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:04:29","modified":"2013-09-27 11:04:29"}},{"id":"4394","content_id":"337","tag_id":"88","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"88","code":"governance","name":"Governance","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:55:35","modified":"2013-09-27 10:55:35"}},{"id":"4395","content_id":"337","tag_id":"109","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"109","code":"environment","name":"Environment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:06:53","modified":"2013-09-27 11:06:53"}},{"id":"4396","content_id":"337","tag_id":"124","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"124","code":"ecologic-institute-gmbh-ecologic","name":"Ecologic Institute GmbH (ECOLOGIC)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-02 14:28:09","modified":"2013-12-02 14:28:09"}},{"id":"4397","content_id":"337","tag_id":"150","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4398","content_id":"337","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"336","code":"marine-resources-and-coastal-livelihoods","user_id":"1","title":"Marine resources and coastal livelihoods","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 15 is out: \"Marine resource management and coastal livelihoods: an Atlantic perspective\", by Elizabeth Tedsen, Benjamin Boteler, Katriona McGlade, Tanja&nbsp;Srebotnjak, and Katrina Abhold at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ecologic.eu\/\">Ecologic Institute<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","body":"<p>Marine ecosystem resources play important roles in coastal countries, providing numerous benefits and services.

At the same time, common challenges and opportunities for marine resource use and management within these countries and across the wider Atlantic can be identified, revealing the need for the strong regional cooperation to promote sustainability, protect marine resources and coastal areas, and maximize benefits for coastal populations.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"628","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 15:00:00","modified":"2016-02-04 22:37:16"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"91","content_id":"336","type":"1","file_name":"336-ATLANTIC FUTURE_15_Marine resources.compressed.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 15: \"Marine resource management and coastal livelihoods: an Atlantic perspective\"","created":"2014-10-09 10:10:20","modified":"2014-10-09 10:10:20"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4452","content_id":"336","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"4445","content_id":"336","tag_id":"162","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"162","code":"resources","name":"resources","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4446","content_id":"336","tag_id":"117","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"117","code":"sustainability","name":"Sustainability","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:14:55","modified":"2013-09-27 11:14:55"}},{"id":"4447","content_id":"336","tag_id":"126","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"126","code":"cooperation","name":"Cooperation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:21:56","modified":"2013-09-30 10:21:56"}},{"id":"4448","content_id":"336","tag_id":"231","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"231","code":"ecosystem","name":"ecosystem","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4449","content_id":"336","tag_id":"235","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"235","code":"resource-management","name":"resource management","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4450","content_id":"336","tag_id":"233","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"233","code":"coastal-protection","name":"coastal protection","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4451","content_id":"336","tag_id":"150","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4452","content_id":"336","tag_id":"26","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"332","code":"the-role-of-language-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"The role of language in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p><strong>[Photo credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/12413207@N03\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Hevron<\/a>]<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 14 is out: \"<\/strong><strong>The community of Portuguese Language Speaking Countries: The role of language in a globalizing world<\/strong><strong>\", by <\/strong><strong>Edalina Rodrigues Sanches<\/strong><strong> at&nbsp;<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ipri.pt\/\">IPRI-UNL<\/a><\/p>","body":"<p>Building on Joseph Nye&rsquo;s concept of soft power, this paper conducts a case study analysis on the role and relevance of language in the Community of Portuguese Language Speaking Countries (CPLP). This organization was built on the shared history and language of its eight member states &ndash; Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao&nbsp;Tome and Principe and Timor-Leste &ndash; and has recently attracted the interest of many states in and out of the Atlantic Basin. In this context, language is one of the assets allowing this organization to increase its international projection and attractiveness. Notwithstanding, it is also true that recent power configurations in the South Atlantic &ndash; with energy and security matters&nbsp;at its core &ndash; has also contributed to increasing the CPLP&rsquo;s &lsquo;magnetism&rsquo;. Hence, we argue that language has allowed the CPLP to project soft power (through the pivotal role played by the governments of Portugal and Brazil), but that language itself has in turn benefited from the economic attractiveness of the organization. Many states in and out of the Atlantic Basin now perceive the CPLP as a relevant forum through which they can reach the &lsquo;Lusophone world&rsquo;. In as much as entering the CPLP requires compliance with certain political values and the adoption of the Portuguese language (or of policies that promote its diffusion) there is a new opportunity to increase language potential.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"312","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 14:04:00","modified":"2016-02-06 14:15:22"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"74","content_id":"332","type":"1","file_name":"332-ATLANTIC FUTURE_14_The community of Portuguese Language Speaking Countries.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 14: \u201cThe community of Portuguese Language Speaking Countries\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 14:05:06","modified":"2014-09-29 14:05:06"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4428","content_id":"332","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},{"id":"4422","content_id":"332","tag_id":"15","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"4423","content_id":"332","tag_id":"195","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"195","code":"brazil","name":"brazil","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4424","content_id":"332","tag_id":"229","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"229","code":"language","name":"language","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4425","content_id":"332","tag_id":"228","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"228","code":"portuguese","name":"portuguese","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4426","content_id":"332","tag_id":"152","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"152","code":"instituto-portugues-de-relaces-internacionais-ipri","name":"Instituto Portugu\u00eas de Rela\u00e7\u00f5es Internacionais (IPRI)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-10 14:59:43","modified":"2013-12-10 14:59:43"}},{"id":"4427","content_id":"332","tag_id":"150","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4428","content_id":"332","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"331","code":"human-mobility-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Human mobility in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 13 is out: \"<\/strong><strong>Geometries of Human Mobility in the Atlantic Space<\/strong><strong>\", by <\/strong><strong>Camila Pastor de Mar&iacute;a Campos<\/strong><strong> at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cide.edu\/\">CIDE<\/a><\/strong><\/p>","body":"<p>This paper is concerned with tracking trends in international migration within the Atlantic basin between 1990 and 2013 and the historical patterns characterizing Atlantic mobility on which these two decades build. The means of tracking migration, of regulating it, and of requesting migrants&rsquo; political and cultural commitment to their host countries have shifted with global economic reconfigurations. Before proceeding to global patterns and concerns around migration and a brief overview of the history of the Atlantic basin as a social space structured by mobility, I reflect on the conceptual tools and analytic strategies which current quantitative sources on human mobility take for granted. For example, historical trajectories and political context are absent from the analyses. Policy driven databases produced by various agencies of international governance afford a vast yet superficial grasp of global mobility patterns, which can be complemented and complicated through smaller scale and longitudinal projects that provide qualitative depth to our understanding of human mobility. Human movement is crucially structured by economic differentials and opportunity, but also by shared colonial histories that sowed specific linguistic skills and social aspirations as they unified political boundaries.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"369","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 14:02:00","modified":"2016-02-08 11:10:54"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"73","content_id":"331","type":"1","file_name":"331-ATLANTIC FUTURE_13_Geometries of Human Mobility in the Atlantic Space.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 13: \u201cGeometries of Human Mobility in the Atlantic Space\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 14:02:53","modified":"2014-09-29 14:02:53"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4127","content_id":"331","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},{"id":"4123","content_id":"331","tag_id":"94","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"94","code":"migration","name":"Migration","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:57:01","modified":"2013-09-27 10:57:01"}},{"id":"4124","content_id":"331","tag_id":"227","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"227","code":"mobility","name":"mobility","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4125","content_id":"331","tag_id":"153","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

In light of South-South Cooperation&rsquo;s emergence as an alternative to traditional aid, the analysis of cooperation in the Atlantic Basin points to an increasingly diverse global South. The diversity, in turn could position the Atlantic as a laboratory for innovative approaches to development cooperation. In the foreseeable future, interaction among Atlantic development partners, whether through cooperation, coordination, or competition, is unlikely to be crystalized into a new institutional set-up but will rather become the sum of dynamic and flexible arrangements reflecting the diversity of actors, interests, and strategies.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"454","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 13:56:00","modified":"2016-02-08 14:09:44"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"71","content_id":"329","type":"1","file_name":"329-ATLANTIC FUTURE_11_Development in the Atlantic.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 11: \u201cDevelopment in the Atlantic: Between cooperation and competition\u201d","created":"2014-09-29 13:57:14","modified":"2014-09-29 13:57:14"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4138","content_id":"329","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},{"id":"4134","content_id":"329","tag_id":"126","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"126","code":"cooperation","name":"Cooperation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:21:56","modified":"2013-09-30 10:21:56"}},{"id":"4135","content_id":"329","tag_id":"15","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"4136","content_id":"329","tag_id":"157","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"157","code":"german-marshall-fund","name":"german marshall fund","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4137","content_id":"329","tag_id":"150","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4138","content_id":"329","tag_id":"25","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"25","code":"people-and-institutions","name":"People and institutions","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"EBC635","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:26"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"328","code":"ideas--norms-and-principles-","user_id":"1","title":"Ideas, Norms and Principles ","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 10 is out: \"Convergence or Divergence of Ideas, Norms, and Principles in the Atlantic?

In other words whether the idea of a &lsquo;pan-Atlantic area&rsquo; is a viable political, social, and cultural concept. More specifically, it explores whether or not the Atlantic space can be characterized as an area of normative convergence. To do so the paper employs insights from the literatures on policy convergence and policy transfer and in particular the &lsquo;soft&rsquo; transfer of policy inputs through transnational networks. Rather than attempt to map the intangible transfer of ideas, norms, and principles across the Atlantic space, the approach taken here is to map the structures through which soft transfer can potentially take place. An analysis of online survey&nbsp;data from 150 environmental NGOs based in Europe, Africa and the Americas reveals a concentration of transnational networks within the Atlantic space, which could potentially contribute to the convergence of ideas, norms, and principles in the area. In this way, the paper argues that the pattern of transnational networks observed provides some supporting evidence of the emergence of an Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"201","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 13:54:00","modified":"2016-01-31 12:55:00"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"70","content_id":"328","type":"1","file_name":"328-ATLANTIC FUTURE_10_Convergence or Divergence of Ideas Norms and Principles.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 10: \"Convergence or Divergence of Ideas, Norms, and Principles in the Atlantic?

The changing&nbsp;geopolitical context in the Atlantic basin and globally is redefining power relations and questioning dominant policy approaches. This is creating new political space and opportunities for Southern Atlantic actors to develop their own institutional frameworks for South-South dialogue and cooperation, distinct from Northern dominated political, economic and security structures, and allow them to develop autonomous options to address common fragility trends, &lsquo;among equals&rsquo;. The geopolitical reality of the Atlantic basin is however far more complex. It extends beyond the Atlantic regions and develops in parallel tracks of competition and cooperation along North-South and South-South asymmetries and convergence. Shared interest and concerns over the impact of fragility and in specific fragile contexts provide an opportunity to test whether and how Atlantic diversity can generate new momentum and more effective approaches to address fragility in the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"342","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"1","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 12:47:00","modified":"2016-02-06 20:02:55"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"92","content_id":"327","type":"1","file_name":"327-ATLANTIC FUTURE_09_Fragiles states.compressed.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 9: \"Fragile States: Challenges and Opportunities for Atlantic Relations\"","created":"2014-10-09 10:17:26","modified":"2014-10-09 10:17:26"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4216","content_id":"327","tag_id":"21","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},{"id":"4211","content_id":"327","tag_id":"130","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"130","code":"human-security","name":"Human security","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-10 11:59:29","modified":"2013-10-10 11:59:29"}},{"id":"4212","content_id":"327","tag_id":"15","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"15","code":"south-atlantic","name":"South Atlantic","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:29:49","modified":"2013-09-27 11:29:49"}},{"id":"4213","content_id":"327","tag_id":"140","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"4214","content_id":"327","tag_id":"157","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"157","code":"german-marshall-fund","name":"german marshall fund","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4215","content_id":"327","tag_id":"150","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4216","content_id":"327","tag_id":"21","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"326","code":"transnational-threats-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Transnational threats in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 8 is out: \"Significant Trends in Illicit Trafficking: A Macro View of the Problem and Potential Means to Address It\", by Dr. Mark R.

We conclude that, although there are obstacles fostering cooperation on maritime security, such cooperation is becoming increasingly relevant to the North and South Atlantic in terms of management of territorial disputes, impacts of climate change, resource protection, regulation of the maritime system and prevention of international crime.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"258","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-29 12:42:00","modified":"2016-02-01 16:23:29"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"67","content_id":"325","type":"1","file_name":"325-ATLANTIC FUTURE_07_Maritime Security in the Atlantic.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 7: \"Maritime Territorial Delimitation and Maritime Security in the Atlantic\"","created":"2014-09-29 12:43:46","modified":"2014-09-29 12:43:46"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4167","content_id":"325","tag_id":"21","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},{"id":"4163","content_id":"325","tag_id":"167","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"167","code":"fundacao-getulio-vargas-fgv-rio-de-janeiro","name":"funda\u00e7ao get\u00falio vargas (fgv) rio de janeiro","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4164","content_id":"325","tag_id":"168","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"168","code":"-brazil","name":" brazil","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4165","content_id":"325","tag_id":"208","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"208","code":"maritime-security","name":"maritime security","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4166","content_id":"325","tag_id":"150","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4167","content_id":"325","tag_id":"21","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"324","code":"the-atlantic-as-a-new-security-area","user_id":"1","title":"The Atlantic as a new security area?","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 6 is out: \"The Atlantic as a new security area?

Far less has involved cooperation between more disparate actors, such as those representing either side of the North and South economic divide. This paper thus seeks to explore nascent trends in North&ndash;South security cooperation in Africa&rsquo;s Atlantic region, with a particular focus on the regions represented by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS). Is an Atlantic area for cooperation forming? Some progress in domains such as maritime security is already discernible. This paper also identifies further areas for cooperation.

It does this by examining the factors that have led to growth in the past and examines the current network of transport links; in particular maritime networks. The paper outlines demand and supply based drivers. It finds on the demand side that the growth of national GDP&rsquo;s has led not only to an increase in goods transported but also to a change in the composition of those goods. Growing GDP has also influenced the mode of transport used to&nbsp;carry goods. Other demand side factors that have influenced the growth of trade include lower trade barriers as a result of trade agreements; the entry into the world economy of former centrally planned command economies as well as the emerging BRICS and NICs and the operations of multinational companies. On the supply side the main influence in promoting networks include the decline in transportation costs brought about by technological changes affecting ships and aircraft coupled with the increase in investment in sea ports and airports as well as the associated development of hub and spoke networks. The development and use of the internet connections has also boosted trade in goods. To regenerate the Atlantic economy will require inter-governmental cooperation to develop economic and political institutions to facilitate economic integration and growth and improve transport networks in the Atlantic economic space.<\/p>","views":"185","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-23 12:54:00","modified":"2016-02-06 02:13:49"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"65","content_id":"311","type":"1","file_name":"311-ATLANTIC FUTURE_05_Technology, Trade and Changes in Transport in the.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 5: \"Technology, Trade and Changes in Transport in the Atlantic Space\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:55:27","modified":"2014-09-23 12:55:27"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"7296","content_id":"311","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"7292","content_id":"311","tag_id":"78","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"78","code":"transport","name":"Transport","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:52:35","modified":"2013-09-27 10:52:35"}},{"id":"7293","content_id":"311","tag_id":"161","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"161","code":"maritime-transport","name":"maritime transport","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"7294","content_id":"311","tag_id":"16","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"7295","content_id":"311","tag_id":"150","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"7296","content_id":"311","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"310","code":"global-value-chains-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Global Value Chains in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 4 is out: \"Global Value Chains in the Atlantic Space\", by Mariana Magaldi de Sousa and Elsy Gonzalez Cubr&iacute;a at<\/strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cide.edu\/\"><strong>CIDE<\/strong><\/a><\/p>","body":"<p>Global value chains (GVCs) have revolutionized trade. Countries no longer have to produce a particular product from scratch; all they must do is insert themselves into an existing chain of production that often spreads across several countries. Nevertheless, insertion into a global value chain has become a real challenge. Economies that are not able to successfully insert&nbsp;themselves into multiple GVCs are likely to reduce their opportunities for industrialization and economic growth. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which countries in the Atlantic Space have inserted themselves into GVCs in the past two decades. It draws on an original dataset of trade patterns by stage of production and value added that spans from 1995 to 2012, collected from the UN COMTRADE databank and the OECD-WTO Trade in Value Added (TiVA) dataset. It finds that despite some interesting cross-country variation, participation in GVCs is still generally low. The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we review the concept of value chain participation and alternative methodologies for measuring it. Section 3 provides a panoramic view of trade flows in the Atlantic, and Section 4 focuses on empirical evidence of GVC participation in two case studies (Mexico and Brazil). Section 5 briefly assesses the available information on trade in value added in selected countries of the Atlantic space and the last Section concludes.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"344","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-23 12:50:00","modified":"2016-02-05 16:19:15"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"64","content_id":"310","type":"1","file_name":"310-ATLANTIC FUTURE_04_Global Value Chains in the Atlantic Space.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 4: \"Global value chains in the Atlantic Space\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:50:39","modified":"2014-09-23 12:50:39"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4182","content_id":"310","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"4179","content_id":"310","tag_id":"16","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"4180","content_id":"310","tag_id":"153","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

Two main research questions are posed: Can Atlantic Space agreements connect the bilateral and multilateral trade frameworks and contribute to a new framework on global trade governance? What are the areas of convergence and divergence between RTAs negotiated in the Atlantic Space and the WTO Agreements? Findings reveal that: firstly, trade liberalisation commitments undertaken with in the Atlantic Space by partner countries are driven by the aim of achieving convergence on trade rules between RTAs with WTO Agreements. Some agreements are, however, aspirational in nature. Second, the degree of trade governance convergence between Atlantic space trading arrangements and the WTO Agreements depends on the level of partner countries&rsquo; development and their integration into the world economy, suggesting that RTAs with countries that are well integrated into the world economy tend to exhibit greater convergence to WTO Agreements. However, there is a clear trend of an overlap between RTAs and WTO Agreements which can be interpreted to mean that regional agreements could support the Atlantic Space&rsquo;s role as a global actor to shape a functioning multilateral order.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"249","shares":"1","tweets":"4","mails":"1","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-23 12:44:00","modified":"2016-02-06 03:24:44"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"63","content_id":"309","type":"1","file_name":"309-ATLANTIC FUTURE_03_Multilateral Agreements and Global Governance of International Trade Regimes.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 3: \"Multilateral Agreements and Global Governance of International Trade Regimes\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:45:22","modified":"2014-09-23 12:45:22"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4190","content_id":"309","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"4187","content_id":"309","tag_id":"88","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"88","code":"governance","name":"Governance","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:55:35","modified":"2013-09-27 10:55:35"}},{"id":"4188","content_id":"309","tag_id":"165","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"165","code":"aberystwyth-university-wales-uk","name":"Aberystwyth University Wales (UK)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-01-15 10:50:33","modified":"2014-01-15 10:50:33"}},{"id":"4189","content_id":"309","tag_id":"150","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4190","content_id":"309","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"308","code":"commercial-ties-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Commercial ties in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p><strong>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 2 is out: \"<\/strong><strong>Commercial Ties in the Atlantic Basin: The Evolving Role of Services and Investment<\/strong><strong>\", by Daniel S.

Services are the sleeping giant of the pan-Atlantic economy. The Atlantic is home to the world's major services economies; Atlantic economies are each other's most important services markets; and Atlantic economies are poised to be major beneficiaries and drivers of the growth in global services. Services are not just a North Atlantic story; they represent a growing area of commercial activity among Southern Atlantic countries as well, particularly in energy related services; engineering and construction services; and education and managerial services. The United States and Europe are global leaders as outward investors and recipients. But today a rising global share of FDI emanates from the developing nations. And whereas trade and investment ties, and bank lending, between these nations and Africa and South and Central America were once shallow and underdeveloped, such linkages are now thicker, more robust and more sophisticated, particularly from China. But the EU remains the largest source of FDI on all Atlantic continents. It is also the largest holder of portfolio assets in North America. Its assets in Africa are roughly equal to those of Asia. North America accounted for over half of South and Central America's portfolio holdings in 2012, with the EU the only other major asset holder. South and Central America's holdings in North America and Europe grew rapidly over the past decade, although from a low base. All told, the Atlantic Hemisphere accounted for 83.8% of EU portfolio assets and 70.2% of North American portfolio assets in 2012.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Download the paper here:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"253","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-09-23 12:27:00","modified":"2016-02-03 21:19:29"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"61","content_id":"308","type":"1","file_name":"308-ATLANTIC FUTURE_02_Commercial ties in the Atlantic Basin.pdf","description":"Scientific paper no. 2: \"Commercial Ties in the Atlantic Basin:\r\nThe Evolving Role of Services and Investment\"","created":"2014-09-23 12:28:39","modified":"2014-09-23 12:28:39"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"4195","content_id":"308","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"4191","content_id":"308","tag_id":"16","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"16","code":"trade","name":"Trade","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:12","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:12"}},{"id":"4192","content_id":"308","tag_id":"160","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"160","code":"investment","name":"investment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"4193","content_id":"308","tag_id":"125","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"125","code":"johns-hopkins-university-jhu","name":"Johns Hopkins University (JHU)","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:19:12","modified":"2013-09-30 10:19:12"}},{"id":"4194","content_id":"308","tag_id":"150","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"150","code":"results","name":"Results","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-12-11 13:44:03","modified":"2013-12-10 14:14:40"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"4195","content_id":"308","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"305","code":"direct-investment-flows-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Direct investment flows in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p>ATLANTIC FUTURE scientific paper no. 1 is out: \"Continuities and changes in patterns of direct investment flows between South America and Africa\", by Katarina Pereira da Costa at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cesem.ma\/\">HEM-CESEM<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>","body":"<p>The countries of Africa and South America have been experiencing in the last years a substantial growth in their direct investment flows, deepening their integration into the international economy.

Both Africa and South America are diversifying their direct investments towards emerging countries, which includes deepening their own bilateral relationship. The main objective of this paper is to present a general analysis of direct investment relations between South America and Africa, and its relations with the world as well as with the two other important actors in the Atlantic space, the US and the EU.

Thirty six prominent students or &lsquo;UP Young Innovators&rsquo; were selected to participate. These were international postgraduate students from a variety of different disciplines from across the University, including political science, engineering and the natural sciences.<\/p>\r\n<p>During the working lunch, the students had the opportunity to discuss some of the key themes of the ATLANTIC FUTURE such as security, the environment, institutional cooperation and migration, among others, with Project&rsquo;s senior researchers R. Andreas Kraemer (Ecologic Institute), Camila Pastor (CIDE), In&ecirc;s Sousa (FGV), and Madeleine Goerg (GMF). Each table gathered around 8 to 10 prominent UP Young Innovators.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ATLANTIC FUTURE working lunch started with opening remarks by Jordi Vaquer (CIDOB), in which he presented the ATLANTIC FUTURE project in a global context. The discussions in each of the tables revolved around the following topics:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The table chaired by In&ecirc;s Catarina Pereira da Costa Sousa (FGV) focused on <strong>security in the Atlantic<\/strong>. Far from being homogeneous, the Atlantic Basin combines different historical and cultural backgrounds, diverse natural features, and distinct levels of development. While these favour numerous economic and political opportunities, they may represent an obstacle in tackling maritime security challenges. The maritime security in the Atlantic becomes strategically important to the North and South Atlantic in terms of resources, regulation of maritime system, prevention of international crime, territorial disputes, and control of terrorist activities. The redistribution and rebalancing of power occurring in the world drive the main stakeholders in the region to look at the Atlantic wider region as a potential space of cooperation. However, are the traditional Atlantic Basin powers (the US and the EU) willing to recognise these new actors? The lunchtime discussions addressed this and other related questions. For example, are Atlantic Basin countries willing to make the Atlantic a priority when formulating their foreign policies? Why is it relevant to look at the Atlantic wider structure as a potential source of maritime security cooperation for Africa? Can we identify common strategic security interests in the Atlantic Basin countries?<\/p>\r\n<p>The table chaired by Camila Pastor (CIDE) focused on <strong>migration in the Atlantic<\/strong>. The discussions mainly concerned international migration in the Atlantic basin between 1990 and 2013, as well as the historical patterns characterizing Atlantic mobility that these two decades build on. Current human mobility is reminiscent of the intense Atlantic mobility in the late nineteenth century but the patterns have changed significantly, as have the means of tracking migration, of regulating it, and of requesting migrants&rsquo; political and cultural commitment to their host countries. In addition, the discussions started with a brief overview of the history of the Atlantic basin as a social space structured by mobility and then also focused on global patterns and concerns around migration.<\/p>\r\n<p>The table chaired by Madeleine Goerg (GMF) focused on <strong>institutional cooperation in the Atlantic<\/strong>. The past decade has seen a broad rebalancing of power and a growing assertiveness of the global South. As hierarchies are redefined and interactions between states redrawn, the Atlantic basin brings the enduring dichotomy between North and South into perspective by pointing to nuanced and complex relations in the realm of institutional cooperation. This discussion sought to address some of the key dynamics in institutional cooperation in the Atlantic basin. It tackled questions such as: with the rise of countries like Brazil and South Africa, how have changing economic dynamics impacted existing forms cooperation? In which policy areas is cooperation most desirable and most effective and at which level? What institutional factors, facilitate or hinder cooperation, and what are the main sources of tension and factors for political cooperation in the current context?<\/p>\r\n<p>The table chaired by R. Andreas Kraemer (Ecologic Institute) focused on <strong>shared environmental issues in the Atlantic<\/strong>. R. Andreas Kraemer started the discussion by summarizing the Atlantic-specific, regional dynamics of global environmental challenges. He explained that the pan-Atlantic is not an abstract of international relations, but a biophysical reality. Beyond a shared physical environment, Atlantic Basin countries also share common histories and starting points. The table then attempted to address whether the interconnected Atlantic space helps to resolve, or instead worsen, shared environmental challenges. On the whole, it was thought that there is high potential for inter-Basin cooperation on resource management based on such similarities and on mutual challenges and interests.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Download the report here:<\/p>","views":"441","shares":"1","tweets":"1","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-06-14 09:00:00","modified":"2016-02-08 08:10:58"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"59","content_id":"199","type":"1","file_name":"199-Working lunch with UP Young Innovators.pdf","description":"","created":"2014-06-13 13:03:25","modified":"2014-06-13 13:03:25"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"3196","content_id":"199","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"3187","content_id":"199","tag_id":"109","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"109","code":"environment","name":"Environment","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 11:06:53","modified":"2013-09-27 11:06:53"}},{"id":"3188","content_id":"199","tag_id":"26","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"26","code":"resources-and-environment","name":"Resources and environment","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"9AC4AB","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:22"}},{"id":"3189","content_id":"199","tag_id":"190","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"190","code":"r-andreas-kraemer","name":"r. andreas kraemer","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3190","content_id":"199","tag_id":"21","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"21","code":"security","name":"Security","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"C31F4A","created":"2013-10-21 17:29:28","modified":"2013-09-27 10:08:37"}},{"id":"3191","content_id":"199","tag_id":"126","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"126","code":"cooperation","name":"Cooperation","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 10:21:56","modified":"2013-09-30 10:21:56"}},{"id":"3192","content_id":"199","tag_id":"94","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"94","code":"migration","name":"Migration","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:57:01","modified":"2013-09-27 10:57:01"}},{"id":"3193","content_id":"199","tag_id":"5","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"5","code":"atlantic-space","name":"Atlantic space","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:55:08","modified":"2013-09-27 09:55:08"}},{"id":"3194","content_id":"199","tag_id":"189","order":"8","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"189","code":"govinn","name":"govinn","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3195","content_id":"199","tag_id":"178","order":"9","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"178","code":"university-of-pretoria","name":"University of Pretoria","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:52:42","modified":"2014-04-24 14:52:42"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"3196","content_id":"199","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"198","code":"roundtable-atlantic-in-a-changing-world","user_id":"1","title":"Roundtable: Atlantic in a changing world","abstract":"<p style=\"margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 18.75pt; margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 16.45pt; vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans','sans-serif'; color: #4c4c4c;\">The ATLANTIC FUTURE workshop in Pretoria was organized by GovInn (Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation), University of Pretoria, in June 2014.

One of the topics that drew more attention was the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) currently under negotiation between the EU and the US.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/198-1402656964.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The main ideas that emerged during the roundtable are summarized below.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Francis Kornegay<\/strong> talked of South Africa&rsquo;s role and its pivot position in the Southern sea lanes. In terms of geopolitics in the Atlantic, there exist major issues that need to be sorted out and, for that, there needs to be a North-South dialogue within the Atlantic. We need to look at different organizations, he said, that go beyond the North Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Sonia Lucarelli<\/strong> spoke of how transatlantic relations have been limited to the North-North relations consolidated during the Cold War. We are currently in the process of deconstructing the concept of transatlantic relations limited to the North, so that it includes a wider, broader, space. But this process of deconstruction is still very preliminary and it has important limitations: there are strong differences such as the North-South divide but also great differences within the South; there are differences in the intensity of relations among the regions, such as economic relations (even if South-South trade has increased, the figures cannot be compared), and others such as migration patterns with huge migrations within the regions. In addition, there are also huge asymmetries in the relations between regions.<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite these weaknesses and limits, however, there is evidence of change in the Atlantic. The North-North line is strong, in spite of the economic crisis, the South-South is also gaining importance, and strategic relations are particularly important. There is need for more transatlantic cooperation, and enhanced dialogue is desperately needed, as there are common challenges that need to be handled together such as demographic trends or food scarcity.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>R. Andreas Kraemer&nbsp;<\/strong>wondered what will happen within the next years with Russia trying to bring back the Cold War dynamics and how will the Atlantic partnership react to that. He spoke of environmental and resources in the Atlantic. The Atlantic makes sense as a unit of analysis, he said, and although of course it is not a closed space, the Atlantic has its own internal dynamics. Regarding environment, R. Andreas Kraemer explained that the main actors in this arena are disruptive actors (the coal, gas, oil lobbies, etc.) and it does not appear to be a counterweight of pro-environmental actors. This asymmetry, he said, may lead to disaster. In particular, climate change will lead to disastrous consequences. He made another point referring to Brazil, an actor that keeps standing on the side and blocking any initiative. Brazil needs to engage, he affirmed.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Claudia S&aacute;nchez Bajo <\/strong>pointed that we are in a transition from thinking the Atlantic as a divided area, as a space of conquest, to thinking about it as a shared zone. There is an effort to make it a zone peace and free of nuclear weapons, which is a big difference with other oceans. For example, the South Atlantic was declared a &ldquo;Free-Zone&rdquo;, and that opened the way for multiple types of pacific cooperation. There is also a discourse of promoting democracy and human rights. Exchanges of values across the Atlantic have taken place. On another topic, she referred to the emergence of clusters of entrepreneurs from both sides, an interesting development that needs to be looked at.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Antonio Fiori<\/strong> referred to the pivot to Asia. From a Pacific perspective, he said, we need to look also from the other side and need to look at another pivot: the pivot of Asia into the Atlantic. The rise of the Pacific is influencing pan-Atlantic dynamics in a number of ways. Firstly, trade between Atlantic and non-Atlantic partners has boomed. China is one of the main actors here, one of the important trade partners in the Atlantic (it is present in Africa, in Latin America), and there are also other Asian partners such as South Korea or Malaysia. This, he pointed out, resembles traditional colonial patterns. For example, 90% of exports to China are commodities, and 90% of imported goods from China are manufactured goods. It is difficult not to think of becoming locked again in colonial-style relationships. Secondly, trade has also created new port facilities, in particular the Panama Canal, with China controlling the leases at both ends of the Canal. Thirdly, the melting ice in the Arctic is also crucial, as it is opening new routes of communication. It has shifted Atlantic and Pacific attention to the Arctic, and China is there. It is predicted that most of Chinese trade will be carried out through the Northern lines in the future.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Jordi Vaquer <\/strong>started his intervention by pointing that oceans divide and do not unite, except of course if one looks at the Ocean itself (in terms of ecological matters and other areas). He pointed at three other obvious aspects related to relations in the Atlantic. Firstly, there are at least two spaces: the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic; secondly, there are too many asymmetries between the North and the South; and thirdly, the Atlantic is not problematic enough so it does not attract attention, and there is no institutional framework of any meaning compared, for example, to APEC. So, he enquired, why should attention be paid to the Atlantic? In bi-ocean countries such as South Africa or Mexico, there is a choice. Why would Mexico pay attention to Africa, when everything is happening in Asia? However, missing their oceanic potential means missing opportunities. He spoke more specifically of the ATLANTIC FUTURE project, where the Atlantic is looked at as a space, as a point where regions meet, and as a microcosm of what is going on in the world. He carried on by raising the issue of the TTIP. Its signature may reconfigure global and European rules hugely. This could make it impossible for the Atlantic space to break tensions. In conclusion, there is opportunity in the Atlantic, but also real threats. In any case, it is worth exploring it. And by neglecting the Atlantic, we may find that it may become interesting for the wrong reasons, he concluded.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the participants&rsquo; interventions, a debate with the audience ensued around a number of topics and issues. R. Andreas Kraemer was of the opinion that oceans don&rsquo;t divide, as traditionally they have facilitated trade, transfer of ideas, etc. So oceans unite us more that they divide us. Francis Kornegay said that South Africa does not have a geostrategic conception of itself, and that if it did it would try to balance its Indian Ocean with its South Atlantic Ocean potential. On territorial conflicts, Jordi Vaquer pointed out that while the Malvinas issue is a problem in the Atlantic, this does not mean that it has to stop any kind of cooperation, as the Gibraltar conflict between Spain and UK does not, for example. Lorenzo Fioramonti (GovInn, University of Pretoria) enquired whether the Atlantic has a qualitative difference to make, and what it would be. The Atlantic, the participants replied, does make a qualitative difference as it has common understandings of many concepts and we could build on. This is the difference with Asia. Finally, the issue of TTIP was raised again. Valerio Briani (IAI) said that TTIP is probably one of the main things happening in the Atlantic after NATO. R. Andreas Kraemer said that the TTIP is the conflict between rights of corporations and the rights of the people, and the fact that we see it as a geographical thing is a mistake. Jordi Vaquer added that TTIP will have huge negative consequences outside, and it is an affront in Europe. It is an assault of corporate power against democracies, he concluded.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Download the Roundtable Report here:<\/p>","views":"429","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-06-13 10:00:00","modified":"2016-02-05 15:46:16"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"57","content_id":"198","type":"1","file_name":"198-Rountable Report_Economic political and social relations.pdf","description":"","created":"2014-06-13 12:47:45","modified":"2014-06-13 12:47:45"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"3127","content_id":"198","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"3122","content_id":"198","tag_id":"186","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"186","code":"ttip","name":"ttip","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3123","content_id":"198","tag_id":"187","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"187","code":"transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership","name":"transatlantic trade and investment partnership","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3124","content_id":"198","tag_id":"189","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"189","code":"govinn","name":"govinn","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3125","content_id":"198","tag_id":"178","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"178","code":"university-of-pretoria","name":"University of Pretoria","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:52:42","modified":"2014-04-24 14:52:42"}},{"id":"3126","content_id":"198","tag_id":"140","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"3127","content_id":"198","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"197","code":"roundtable-africa-in-the-atlantic","user_id":"1","title":"Roundtable: Africa in the Atlantic","abstract":"<p>The ATLANTIC FUTURE workshop in Pretoria was organized by GovInn (Centre for the Study of Governance Innovation), University of Pretoria, in June 2014.

South Africa, he pointed out, used to have an interest in the Atlantic but no longer has it. South Africa is interested in Asia, the EU and the US. The only real awareness is on overexploitation of resources largely by European companies. On the TTIP, Cilliers made remarks on the geostrategic implications. TTIP is an effort to maintain Western dominance. It changes economic dynamics and it has energy implications, which has a renewed momentum given the Russia - Ukraine issue. So, countries have two options: either to join this one third of the world, or to opt out. For Africa, because there are such low levels of internal trade, the implications of TTIP would be that may force regional integration in Africa, and also force Africa to look further into Asia and the Pacific, because TTIP will cause loss of trade for Africa. For the future of the Atlantic, discussions need to take hard geostrategic drivers into consideration. Countries in the South Atlantic remain much less important countries in this future world, he said.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Andrew Grant <\/strong>spoke aboutaspects that do not get much attention, such as the Kimberly process on diamonds.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Catherine Grant<\/strong> also referred to the TTIP. She said that the reality of economic linkages of South Africa is that there are strong investment ties with the US and the EU. This is not an ideal picture, she said, but it is South Africa&rsquo;s real picture (with the exception of China). And, she added, there is no particular role of Africa in an emerging Atlantic space, as this is very much dominated by the Northern Atlantic. Africa would not favour Atlantic space over other alliances, because we are still seeing the failure of the US and the EU to carry out any real institutional reform in the economic space. When the space is dominated by these two players, and they are not prepared to recognize the changes in the world, why would Africa be interested in pursuing an Atlantic agenda, she wondered.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Garth Le Pere<\/strong> spoke of the two registers along which Africa can be placed in this emerging Atlantic: the instrumental and the normative one. The instrumental one is capitalist in spirit. The normative one is the US and the EU development cooperation agenda (good governance, institutions, etc.). Both tend to reinforce each other, he said. He also talked about the issue of climate change and pointed that Africa has very low and problematic adaptive responses.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Brendan Vickers<\/strong> said that African countries should engage Atlantic counterparts on African priorities. There are three things he considered to be the African priorities: firstly, structural transformation, as Africa needs to shift from export of commodities to a more sustainable growth; secondly, regional and continental integration; and thirdly, infrastructure development. These, he added, are going to require some kind of closer partnership with Atlantic partnership. He also pointed that it makes no sense to speak of one Atlantic region, as one needs to differentiate between North Atlantic and South Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the participants&rsquo; interventions, a lively debate with the audience ensued around a number of topics and issues, particularly on the TTIP. In this sense, <strong>Lorenzo Fioramonti<\/strong> (GovInn, Univesrity of Pretoria), stated that the TTIP is the most astute way of dodging Doha. Is there an Africa proactive reaction to TTIP or are we just waiting for it to happen, he enquired. In Brendan Vickers&rsquo; view, the focus of US and EU is on TTIP, and it is about raising standards. There is very little Africans can do about TTIP, so Africans should focus on what they have control over, that is the regional and continental integration process. The priority should be infrastructure development, etc. There is a need to focus on the continental FTA. Africa needs to become an actor and not a pawn, he added.<\/p>\r\n<p>On another subject, Jakkie Cilliers referred to the idea of a single integrated Africa as a mirage. He also referred to demographics as something that will have a huge impact in the future. Africa is currently one billion people and will be two billion by 2050. On the other hand, Europe is 500 million now and will remain 500 million by 2050. This is something to reflect about, he concluded.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Download the Rountable Report here:<\/p>","views":"269","shares":"0","tweets":"2","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-06-13 09:00:00","modified":"2016-02-03 01:53:50"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"56","content_id":"197","type":"1","file_name":"197-Rountable Report_Africa in the Atlantic.pdf","description":"","created":"2014-06-13 12:28:08","modified":"2014-06-13 12:28:08"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"3238","content_id":"197","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"3232","content_id":"197","tag_id":"140","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"140","code":"africa","name":"Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:33","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:33"}},{"id":"3233","content_id":"197","tag_id":"179","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"179","code":"south-africa","name":"South Africa","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:53:06","modified":"2014-04-24 14:53:06"}},{"id":"3234","content_id":"197","tag_id":"186","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"186","code":"ttip","name":"ttip","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3235","content_id":"197","tag_id":"187","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"187","code":"transatlantic-trade-and-investment-partnership","name":"transatlantic trade and investment partnership","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}},{"id":"3236","content_id":"197","tag_id":"178","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"178","code":"university-of-pretoria","name":"University of Pretoria","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-04-24 14:52:42","modified":"2014-04-24 14:52:42"}},{"id":"3237","content_id":"197","tag_id":"189","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"189","code":"govinn","name":"govinn","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":null,"created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"3238","content_id":"197","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"54","code":"seminar-for-young-researchers-in-mexico","user_id":"1","title":"SEMINAR FOR YOUNG RESEARCHERS IN MEXICO","abstract":"<p>On 21 February 2014, CIDE organised a seminar with students of International Relations with an interest in the subject of Atlantic. More than 50 students attended the seminar. Several senior ATLANTIC FUTURE researchers participated in the seminar: R. Andreas Kraemer at Ecologic Institute (Germany), Alfredo Valladao at HEM (Morocco), Paul Isbell at Johns Hopkins University (United States) and Mark Aspinwall at CIDE (Mexico). Lorena Ruano at CIDE (Mexico) acted as the moderator.<\/p>","body":"<p>Lorena Ruano (CIDE) presented the ATLANTIC FUTURE project to the students, highlighting its main features. Next, Alfredo Valladao (HEM) spoke about the strengths of the Atlantic. While everybody talks about the Pacific and the emergence of China, he expressed to be sceptical about that. It is the Atlantic century we are going to see coming up, he noted, and not only the North Atlantic but the South Atlantic too. He made the following points: <strong>the new reserves of energy are in the Atlantic, and energy is the core of development and economic life.<\/strong> There is a huge basin of energy that can put us together and make the Atlantic one of the centres of energy producing of the world. Furthermore, North America and South America are the biggest food producers in the world. Africa and Latin America still have a huge stock of free land and water. There are environmental problems, he conceded, but <strong>we can see the Atlantic as a bread basket for the world<\/strong>. That is a huge area where we can have good cooperation. Thirdly, <strong>the Atlantic is home to huge consumer markets<\/strong>. The US alone represents about 1\/3 of the final private consumer, while China only accounts for 4-5% of the world&rsquo;s private consumption. In a world where consumption leads production, the Atlantic will play an enormous role of consumer market for the world&rsquo;s production. Some countries in Africa are developing fast, which will be a huge opportunity for business, cross-interests, production, consumers, etc. But more important, we are living today a real industrial revolution: from the old model of production chains of mass production for mass consumption to new model: that of ICT tech, 3D printing, advanced robotics, etc. That will be very difficult to replicate in some countries in Asia like China, while in the Atlantic there are a lot of possibilities to do that, where societies open enough to be part of this ICT, to be part of it and take advantage of it. Atlantic will probably be the core of the new revolution of the world. Future economic production and consumption will be more centred in the Atlantic.&nbsp; He clarified, though, that this does not mean that it has to be against the Pacific.<\/p>\r\n<p>Paul Isbell (JHU) added that the <strong>Atlantic<\/strong><strong> is a new unit of analysis as well as a tool for new forms of international collaboration<\/strong>. Coming from a view of the Pacific rise, energy dependence to the Middle East, and the rise of the global South, he explained how when drawing an energy map, it revealed that most mental maps that had to do with the Atlantic and energy were either incorrect or beginning to change dramatically. There is a boom in Atlantic energy resources, reserves, in production, shale revolution, the rising role of gas, and other related forms of energy. The Atlantic is almost self-sufficient in energy. <strong>The energy story is really an Atlantic one<\/strong>, he concluded.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mark Aspinwall (CIDE) added how colonisation had a profound effect in linking together Europe, Africa and the Americas. <strong>The Atlantic is a coherent and fundamentally linked area, where there are important flows in terms of values and ideas<\/strong>. The whole idea of international collaboration and international rules is an Atlantic idea and continue to be generated in the Atlantic in an important way. In terms of economics, there has been a huge increase in services, trade and investment in the Atlantic. In terms of security, continued Lorena Ruano (CIDE), NATO is the main military alliance we have today with the most important capacity in terms of military gear and coordination. But one cannot forget that when thinking about the Atlantic, we mostly think of the North Atlantic. The most important economic exchanges happen in the North Atlantic. <strong>The North Atlantic is still dominant but the fastest rising links are in the South Atlantic<\/strong>, especially between Brazil and Africa. The South Atlantic, she concluded, is coming into the picture very fast.<\/p>\r\n<p>In R. Andreas Kraemer&rsquo;s view (Ecologic Institute), the Atlantic story remains strong. Something very important to consider is <strong>the role of China in the Atlantic<\/strong> today. He also made the point that energy systems, all technology providers, all big companies, are Atlantic, which is very disruptive for the environment. But <strong>there is also a problem of solving capacity<\/strong>. In natural resources there is also disruption (with overfishing, destroyed ecosystems, etc.)&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we try to find the best practices, we find them in the North East Atlantic. We can look at them and apply them in other places.<\/p>\r\n<p>Alfredo Valladao (HEM) pointed at one specific problem: there are many challenges. In terms of civil society, things are going quite well: <strong>there is a huge interchange of values, ideas, and people in the Atlantic<\/strong>. And because there is a lot of freedom of travelling and information, the Atlantic is the cradle of cosmopolitan society. In the business sphere, there are a lot of things going on, services and investment, lot of cross investment in countries in the Atlantic. The real challenge is institutionalizing the dialogue, because of bad perceptions. <strong>The Atlantic probably is the space with more regional integration schemes<\/strong>. Brazil is the &ldquo;big guy&rdquo; in the South Atlantic. While it still sees the South Atlantic as its own, it does not have the capabilities to manage it. It is very important to have a real dialogue with Brazil. And Africa is also key. Finally, he referred to the potential for new form of collaboration. Instead of trying to make big schemes, we should concentrate in solving concrete and specific problems together, such as drug trafficking. To sum up, we should look at solvable problems that are Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>An interesting debate with the students ensued. Questions such as the role of Mexico in the Atlantic, what were the effects of being a dual basin country, or the level of institutionalism in the Atlantic were only a few of them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Check photos of the Seminar for Young Researchers below:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395739895.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" style=\"font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 21.920000076293945px;\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395740829.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395740339.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395741703.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"tab-image-container\"><img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395741302.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img class=\"tab-image\" src=\"..\/..\/..\/..\/images\/contents\/54-1395742732.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>","views":"266","shares":"0","tweets":"1","mails":"2","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-03-24 14:54:00","modified":"2016-02-01 20:22:23"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"2694","content_id":"54","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"2675","content_id":"54","tag_id":"153","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

the seminar organized by the ATLANTIC FUTURE, CIDE in Mexico organised a public event with keynote speaker <strong>Jos&eacute; Miguel Insulza, Secretary General of the Organization of American States<\/strong> (OAS) under the title <strong>&ldquo;America in the Atlantic Space&rdquo;<\/strong>. The conference, open to the public and which attracted a large audience, was held at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City on February 21, 2014.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Several issues concerning the role and the future of Latin America in the wider Atlantic space were discussed, with particular attention to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the US and the EU currently under negotiation.<\/p>","body":"<p>The OAS&nbsp;Secretary General Jos&eacute; Miguel Insulza spoke of the renewal of the Atlantic space and noted that the ATLANTIC FUTURE project is very timely in this context. In recent times, there has been an intellectual and political resurrection of the Atlantic, whose decline was announced prematurely. We are almost used to talk about the Pacific century, he said. Certainly, the rise of Asia is a central phenomenon of our era, but this rise does not occur at the expense of the Atlantic. <strong>The 21st century is not the century of the Pacific but the century of globalization<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Insulza noted, as one of the main issues, the <strong>Transatlantic Agreement negotiations on Trade and Investment (TTIP)<\/strong>, which would unite about 50 % of world output and 20% of foreign direct investment if signed. At the same time, he continued, another agreement for the Pacific (TPP) is under negotiation, with 12 countries representing over 38% of world GDP involved. Insulza placed these negotiations in the context of the<strong> emergence of mega - blocks<\/strong>, and noted that these agreements seek to establish new rules that respond to the realities of the 21st century. It is a context of formation of mega-blocks.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Secretary General highlighted the <strong>global value chains as the second major theme in the Atlantic space<\/strong>. He referred to the geographical fragmentation of production, structured in global value chains, and to the fact that the impact on world trade and investment flows are significant. Today, he stressed, the products we receive are \"made in the world&rdquo;. The centre of the value chain will remain where the development of innovation, scientific development and capital is, said Insulza.<\/p>\r\n<p>Insulza referred to Latin America as one of the economic successes of the last decade, but that now faces the risk of not being able to maintain the achievements. They have the challenge of integration into the world economy and its relationship with the mega - blocks as well as the challenge of a more equitable and sustainable growth.<\/p>\r\n<p>He added that export diversification is very important for the Atlantic space in the immediate future. A <strong>greater trade integration of production is needed<\/strong> to reap the benefits of integration. Intraregional trade in Latin America is dominated by trade in final goods. So the challenge may represent a potential transatlantic relations throughout the region. The relationship between the European Union and Latin America has evolved tremendously over the last 30 years. In 2010 Mercosur generated almost half of exports to the European Union. Mexico and Cariforum have a much greater participation in imports from the European Union. There is great potential for growth.<\/p>\r\n<p>Insulza described the fact that most attention goes to Atlantic space because of the start of the negotiations for the TTIP as a great paradox, as this is limited to the more traditional members of the Atlantic Alliance. He warned not to mix the bilateral trade agreement with the creation of a true Atlantic space. <strong>The TTIP is limited to the North Atlantic, but the dialogue should include the rest<\/strong>. Insulza also referred to the importance of South -South relationship. The Secretary- General went on to say that there is a <strong>risk of excluding the South from the dialogue on the Atlantic space<\/strong>. It is time to \"<em>join our voices for a renewed Atlantic space with some cooperation mechanism Atlantic space<\/em>\". In such a framework and voluntarily, Atlantic countries could cooperate on many issues, not only commercial but also environmental and many others.<\/p>\r\n<p>The <strong>emergence of mega - blocks and globalization pose serious challenges<\/strong> for the region. America is the only continent that is Atlantic and Pacific at a time. It could happen that participation in both is possible, or that the label Pacific country or Atlantic country is seen as a new division block.<\/p>\r\n<p>After Jos&eacute; Miguel Isulza speech, a round of questions was opened to the public. Issues such as the negotiation of TTIP, the risks of Mexico looking more towards the Pacific, the key issues for Latin America, or the alleged competition between TPP and TTIP, among others, were addressed.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Download the full conference report here:<\/p>","views":"228","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2014-02-27 09:00:00","modified":"2016-02-01 20:13:12"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[{"id":"54","content_id":"196","type":"1","file_name":"196-Conference Report_America in the Atlantic_Mexico.pdf","description":"","created":"2014-06-13 11:40:17","modified":"2014-06-13 11:40:17"}],"ContentTag":[{"id":"3176","content_id":"196","tag_id":"20","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"20","code":"economy-and-finance","name":"Economy and finance","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"A85CA0","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:57:02"}},{"id":"3170","content_id":"196","tag_id":"170","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"170","code":"mexico","name":"Mexico","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2014-01-15 11:11:11","modified":"2014-01-15 11:11:11"}},{"id":"3171","content_id":"196","tag_id":"143","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"143","code":"america","name":"America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:41:45","modified":"2013-10-25 10:41:45"}},{"id":"3172","content_id":"196","tag_id":"141","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"141","code":"latin-america","name":"Latin America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:20:43","modified":"2013-10-25 10:20:43"}},{"id":"3173","content_id":"196","tag_id":"153","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"153","code":"centro-de-investigacion-y-docencia-economicas-ac-cide","name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas A.C.

During the working lunch, the emerging leaders were given an opportunity to discuss some of the key themes of the ATLANTIC FUTURE, from security to energy, global governance to regionalism, and migration to trade, with senior researchers.<\/p>","body":"<p>The table-top discussions were chaired by representatives of the ATLANTIC FUTURE and gathered around ten emerging leaders each. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.atlanticdialogues.org\/about-the-atlantic-dialogues\/young-leaders\/atlantic-dialogues-emerging-leaders-agenda-2013\/\"><strong><em>2013 Atlantic Dialogues Emerging Leaders Program<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/a>brought together forty-eight rising leaders from around the Atlantic Basin and focused on the exchange of ideas, peer to peer learning, and skills to effect change. The ATLANTIC FUTURE working session served as the topical introduction to <em>The Atlantic Dialogues<\/em> conference which the young leaders attended as well and where some of the scholars engaged in the ATLANTIC FUTURE project had an active role. Launched in 2012,<em>&nbsp;The Atlantic Dialogues<\/em>&nbsp;is emerging as a leading annual forum for decision makers to discuss global issues and partnerships, with an emphasis on the Southern Atlantic and transatlantic relations beyond traditional north-north lines. This high-level gathering is a unique opportunity for leaders from the four continents of the Atlantic to debate the changing dynamics across the wider basin and help shape the broader transatlantic agenda.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ATLANTIC FUTURE working lunch started with opening remarks by Corinna H&ouml;rst, Deputy Director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States&rsquo; Brussels office, in which she presented the ATLANTIC FUTURE project in a global context and introduced the goals and deliverables. The following group discussions focused on multilateralism (WP1), economic trends (WP2), security issues (WP3), norms in the Atlantic (WP4\/5), and regionalism (WP8).<\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>The Atlantic world and the Future of Multilateralism<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Atlantic world and the Future of Multilateralism&rdquo; discussion was chaired by Emiliano Alessandri, Senior Transatlantic Fellow, German Marshall Fund of the United States. In light of changing dynamics in global and regional multilateral organizations, the discussion focused on whether ongoing power shifts will lead to more or less multilateralism in the Atlantic. Other axis of reflection included the impact of growing economic interdependence on international cooperation around the Atlantic Basin and what Atlantic dynamics can tell us about larger developments at the global level.<\/p>\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n<li><strong>Overcoming the North-South Divide: Economic Re-balancing in the Atlantic<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>This discussion was chaired by Chris Hoornaert, Ambassador of the Port Authority of Antwerp, Port Authority of Antwerp and focused on trends in trade and investment in the Atlantic.<\/p>\r\n<p>The South Atlantic space has in the last decade won greater economic and political autonomy from the United States and Europe. Trade and investment have been growing fast in the South-South Atlantic relationship, and the regions of the South are also witnessing a reconfiguration in political influence. China has become a major partner of African as well as Latin American economies. The rift between the West and the Global South still defines to a large extent the rules for interaction but new relationships are also emerging that defy the North-South divide. In this context, the discussion also addressed the question of the extent to which, asthe South Atlantic space gains greater economic weight, re-balancing will lead to greater cooperation or competition in the region.<\/p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong>Atlantic Security: Towards a Pan-Atlantic approach?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>Nicoletta Pirozzi, Senior Fellow, Istituto Affari Internazionali chaired the discussion &ldquo;Atlantic Security: Towards a Pan-Atlantic approach?&rdquo; The Atlantic North and South have witnessed much lower levels of inter-state conflict than other areas of the world, and the South Atlantic is one of the few regions of the world that is free of weapons of mass destruction. Nonetheless, as some states grow stronger than others and competition for resources increases, military build-ups or other forms of traditional threats should not be discarded. In this context the discussion centered on the likelihood for new comprehensive Atlantic cooperation frameworks and the areas of security policy in which greater progress could be made.<\/p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li><strong>Moving in the Same Direction? Norms in the Atlantic.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Moving in the Same Direction? Norms in the Atlantic&rdquo; was chaired by Camilla Adelle, Research Fellow at the University of Pretoria. This session addressed the role of transnational networks of state and non-state actors in the soft transfer of ideas, norms and principles in building an Atlantic region. Areas covered include: whether the pan-Atlantic region is becoming a &ldquo;community&rdquo; in which key ideas, norms, and principles are bound to converge; which are the most relevant processes through which ideas, norms, and principles are transferred, contested, and re-conceptualized; whether the North-South rebalancing overall is leading to greater alignment or discrepancy between value systems; and what sub-regions or countries can play a leading role moving the debate on norms forward at the Atlantic level?<\/p>\r\n<p>5.<strong> Shifting Regionalism<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>R. Andreas Kraemer, Founding Director and CEO, Ecologic Institute,Berlin, chaired the discussion on &ldquo;Shifting Regionalism.&rdquo; This conversation focused on whether and how the emergence of powerful regional actors having an impact on regional integration processes and affecting inter-regional cooperation across the Atlantic Basin. The emerging leaders also discussed the direction of regional integration, whether actors around the Atlantic Basin are moving toward greater simplification of regional cooperation efforts or greater diversity and plurality of initiatives.<\/p>\r\n<p>The participants were very enthusiastic about the opportunity to engage with the senior scholars and learn about different perspectives to the Atlantic space and engaged in lively discussions on topics relevant to the Atlantic Future project. Indeed, the sessions provided this diverse group of Emerging Leaders with new perspectives on transatlantic relations, as a whole, and their respective topics more specifically. The emerging leaders were better able to identify and conceptualize the wider Atlantic space through the working lunch discussions. By addressing issues from security to trade through the lens of the Atlantic Basin, the ATLANTIC FUTURE working lunch prepared the Emerging Leaders to take full advantage of the exchanges during the <em>Atlantic Dialogues<\/em>, imprinting on them a lasting understanding of this &ldquo;new&rdquo; geopolitical space. The working lunch also provided researchers of the ATLANTIC FUTURE project with an opportunity to discuss their findings with a critical audience, and gain input on their research from Emerging Leaders from Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, and Europe.<\/p>\r\n<p>A PDF presentation of the Working Lunch is attached.<\/p>\r\n<p>Check photos of the Working Lunch below:<\/p>\r\n<p

in Rabat, Morocco, where a panel of experts shared their interesting views on the topic with an audience of 200 people. The event took place on 25 October 2013 at <em>Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale du Royaume du Maroc<\/em> (Morocco National Library), after a 2-day seminar as part of the first plenary meeting of the ATLANTIC FUTURE.<\/p>","body":"<p>The conference was chaired by Driss Ksikes (Director of CESEM, HEM) and counted with a panel of five speakers: Abderrahmane Hadj Nacer, economist and former governor of the Central Bank of Algeria, Bichara Khader, Professor at UCL, Belgium, Karim El Aynaoui, Senior Researcher at OCP Policy Center, Alfredo Valladao, Senior Researcher at HEM and Jordi Vaquer, Senior Associate of CIDOB and Scientific Coordinator of ATLANTIC FUTURE.<\/p>\r\n<p>The speakers covered a wide range of topics related to the Arab world and the Atlantic space. The chair <strong>Driss Ksikes<\/strong> opened the conference by giving an overview of the project Atlantic Future and by pointing at the Atlantic potential for growth. He referred to Morocco as a country that materializes the link between the Arab world and the Atlantic space. <strong>Bichara Khader<\/strong> spoke of the extreme verticality of the relationship between Europe and the Maghreb and of the need for Arab countries to reach Africa and Latin America. The exchanges between Brazil and the Arab world have increased a lot in the recent times. He also referred to the role of new international actors such as China or the United States in the years to come<strong>.<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Abderrahmane<\/strong> <strong>Hadj Nasser <\/strong>spoke of the relevance of monetary control. Money is trust. He referred to the Quincy Agreement in 1945 between U.S. president Roosevelt and the King of Saudi Arabia. In his view, the agreement represented that trust is no longer based on a particular resource but on the authoritarian control of resources.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Jordi Vaquer<\/strong> said that there is a tendency to forget Africa in the Atlantic history. He viewed the Atlantic no only as an area of opportunities but also of threats to certain countries, due to issues such as piracy or the drug trafficking routes. He also referred to fragile countries and also to other countries that are well governed but that despite this they are still vulnerable, such as the case of Cape Verde. On the cultural field, he insisted on the great amount of links that exist within the Atlantic space. A great part of the music in the world, for example, is of Atlantic origin. Referring to social links, he spoke of the change that has taken place, as flows are not one-way anymore. For example, there are more Portuguese citizens in Angola now than there were in the colonial times, and Morocco can also be an opportunity for Spanish citizens. He also referred to social movements in Tunisia or Morocco, which inspired the 15-M in Spain, the Somos 37 in Chile, etc. He also referred to food security as an important issue in the Atlantic. While the Atlantic contains the biggest amounts of water reserves, there are areas (such as Subsaharan Africa) that suffer food security issues.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Alfredo Valladao<\/strong> focused on the relationship between the Gulf countries and the BRICs, and referred to the shift towards the Atlantic in the oil production. The geopolitical implications of such shift are enormous, he said, as Gulf countries face a loss of negotiation and strategic power. He also spoke of the strong dependency of BRICs towards China and India. On China, he referred to potential internal problems that could affect its growth.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Karim El Aynaoui<\/strong> pointed out that Brazil and China growth is slowing down. He also criticized Europe for not being aware of the developments in the South. The flow of production factors, he said, is an important question. He concluded that here are many questions that need to be posed in order to understand the current shifts.<\/p>\r\n<p>An interesting debate and exchange of ideas ensured among the speakers on different topics and issues.<strong> Driss Ksikes<\/strong> added that there is a perception that the Atlantic is a pacific area and that it is a community of values. He wondered whether there is a clash between the values of the Arab \/ Islam world and the values of the Atlantic world. Also, he questioned the implications of the loss of strategic power of the Gulf countries. He finally referred to the potential of innovation and mobility within the Atlantic space. On a different topic, <strong>Abderrahmane<\/strong> <strong>Hadj Nasser<\/strong> referred to wahabism, and pointed that flows and linkages mean to be conditioned to the rest of the world, and therefore it is important to integrate wahabism. <strong>Bichara Khader<\/strong> regretted the fact that the Arab world is closed due to internal problems in a time when the world is being redesigned. <strong>Karim El Aynaoui<\/strong> added that Morocco has to define its place in the Atlantic. <strong>Alfredo Valladao<\/strong> also spoke of the fundamental role of the Atlantic space as an area of connections, exchange of ideas, capacity to intermix, and great capabilities for dialogue. <strong>Jordi Vaquer<\/strong> concluded that the Atlantic space will be built through a tissue of links rather than through a big institution, and through bilateral relations rather than based on a comprehensive agreement.<\/p>\r\n<p>The floor was opened to the public and a very lively debate ensued with the audience, with issues such as the relationship between development and peace, climate change, food security, piracy or energy poverty, among others.<\/p>\r\n<p>The conference was conducted in French and translation services into English were available.<\/p>\r\n<p>A Pdf version of the report is attached.<\/p>\r\n<p>Below you can see some photos of the event.<\/p>\r\n<p

Under the title &ldquo;<em>Rediscovering the Atlantic space<\/em>&rdquo;, the issue (in Spanish) sheds light on the processes taking place in the Atlantic space, not very explored yet.<\/p>","body":"<p>The Atlantic Basin is becoming a central scenario for globalization and, as such, it deserves the same attention as the emerging Pacific area. Within the Atlantic space, there are growing links in the fields of energy, commerce, human security, norms, values and other issues related to the ocean itself. As interdependency relations grow through this basin, new opportunities emerge, but also new vulnerabilities affect its interlinking societies. With more and more urgent common problems, Atlantic states and regions are seeking with renewed interest their counterparts in all shores of the ocean. Authors from different shores of the Atlantic, some of them partners of ATLANTIC FUTURE or members of our Scientific and Advisory Panel, analyse from a wide range of theoretical and empirical orientations the consequences of the current changes and transformations within the Atlantic space.<\/p>\r\n<p>Check the contents <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cidob.org\/en\/publications\/publication_series\/revista_cidob_d_afers_internacionals\/rediscovering_the_atlantic_space\" target=\"_blank\">here.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cidob.org\/en\/publications\/articulos\/revista_cidob_d_afers_internacionals\/102_103\/introduction_a_new_perspective_on_the_atlantic\">Introduction: a new perspective on the Atlantic<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Anna Ayuso and Elina Viilup<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cidob.org\/en\/publications\/articulos\/revista_cidob_d_afers_internacionals\/102_103\/atlantic_communities_asymmetries_and_convergences\">Atlantic communities: asymmetries and convergences<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Dorval Brunelle<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cidob.org\/en\/publications\/articulos\/revista_cidob_d_afers_internacionals\/102_103\/towards_a_governance_agenda_for_the_emerging_atlantic_hemisphere\">Towards a governance agenda for the emerging Atlantic Hemisphere<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Daniel S.

Trade and investment have been growing fast in the South-South Atlantic relationship, and the regions of the South are also witnessing a reconfiguration in political influence.<\/p>","body":"<p>The South Atlantic space has in the last decade won greater economic and political autonomy from the US and Europe. The dynamic Asian markets have driven the economic growth of major South American countries (such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile or Peru), most notably in the sector of commodities, both non-renewable (such as mineral and fossil fuels) and renewable (such as agricultural products). Asian, mainly Chinese, products have been flooding markets across the region. An even more dramatic shift has taken place in Africa, where the search for commodities has attracted unprecedented levels of Chinese investment, and has fuelled economic growth and further investment from other non-traditional sources such as the Gulf States, India, Malaysia or Brazil.<\/p>\r\n<p>Trade and investment in the South-South Atlantic have been growing fast, both within the Atlantic space and between the Atlantic and extra-Atlantic partners. Trade between Brazil and Africa has increased six fold between 2000 and 2011 (from US$4.2 billion to US$27.6 billion), and Brazil is the third largest trade partner of Africa as a whole, after China and India. Oil-producing Nigeria and Angola account for almost 50% of these trade flows. At the same time, China-Africa trade, driven by commodities, has grown more than ten-fold over the last decade, doubling in nominal terms every three years. The share of Brazil&rsquo;s trade with the other BRICs jumped from 9% to 17% in the space of only three years, from 2006 to 2009. The old, largely rhetoric South-South cooperation has evolved into a complex relationship which involves a growing number of actors with different objectives; among them are transnational corporations and powerful lobbies but also cities, language communities or diasporas.<\/p>\r\n<p>The regions of the South are also witnessing a reconfiguration in political influence. North Atlantic powers are losing ground, thus allowing non-Atlantic actors to seek new influence and regional actors to emerge. In Sub-Saharan Africa, political investment by South Africa and other regional players in the African Union and sub-regional organizations is paralleled by a creeping &lsquo;multipolarisation&rsquo; of continental politics. In particular, South Africa and Nigeria aim to consolidate their role as regional leaders and important interlocutors for third partners beyond Africa. Together with Brazil and India, South Africa has launched the IBSA format for political dialogue and economic cooperation, has invested in the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) platform on climate change negotiations and joined the BRICS in 2011. At the same time, it has developed a strategic partnership with the EU, with the latter seeking to strike a new balance between bilateral and inter-regional engagement both in Africa and in South America. Nigeria is seeking political benefits from its pivotal role in energy flows, accounting for 11% of US oil imports, 16% of South Africa&rsquo;s and 8% of India&rsquo;s.<\/p>\r\n<p>North Africa, long time stagnant at the political and economic level, is at the heart of changes that are shaking the Arab world and transforming its political and social landscape. The problems that still trouble the region &ndash; youth unemployment, gender inequality, lack of competitiveness and dismal research and innovation rates &ndash; could be overcome faster than expected if the current transformation liberates new creative energies in all fields, from economy to social structures. North Africa is moving beyond its dependency on Europe and slowly globalizing its international partners, searching for new opportunities in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Gulf.<\/p>\r\n<p>In South America, Brazil&rsquo;s external projection is manifest in its solid regional engagement and good cooperation with its neighbours. Brazil, as a leading investor in South America, has sought to deliver new impulse to MERCOSUR (Common Southern Market) and is providing political impetus to regional cooperation through new formats such as UNASUR (Union of South American Nations) and the CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States). Also thanks to such initiatives, cooperation and integration processes have acquired new dynamism in South America. A shift has been taking place from mainly liberalisation-based economic integration towards a more physical and political agenda that includes asymmetries, complementarities and dispute resolution forums. Against this backdrop, the US and the EU have reached out to Brazil to establish and develop bilateral strategic partnerships.<\/p>","views":"523","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"2","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-07-24 18:26:00","modified":"2016-02-05

A global order in evolution contextualises the research of ATLANTIC FUTURE.<\/p>","body":"<p>The international order, as established at the end of World War II, has changed beyond recognition over the last two decades. The triumph of the North Atlantic powers in the Cold War slowly started to give way to <strong>a redistribution of power in all its dimensions<\/strong> (hard and soft, political and economic), which currently is the predominant trend reshaping the international system. It includes both <strong>power shifts among state actors, most notably towards Asia, and the diffusion of power away from states to a variety of non-state actors.<\/strong> However, that power transition does not seem to lead to a succession of US pre-eminence. On the one hand, the material resources of the US remain unparalleled across most dimensions of power, although the economic crisis is seriously affecting the country&rsquo;s profile on the international stage. On the other hand, no individual country, or group of countries, seems able to replace the US in its traditional role of milieu-shaping and provision of global public goods for the foreseeable future. Reforming multilateral frameworks, therefore, is going to be critical to ensure openness and stability of a polycentric international system. Creation of new formats such as the G20 and a progressive transformation of existing institutions, such as the IMF, are part of the adjustment to the new realities. A more open multilateralism is emerging with the diversification of the multilateral playing fields and the emergence of new actors in multilateralism other than states.<\/p>\r\n<p>A general shift of power away from the Northern Atlantic towards the Pacific, or even the Asian heartland, is a defining feature of contemporary international relations, particularly in terms of economic dynamism. The centre of growth is situated in Asia, with China as a major player. Latin America, with Brazilian leadership, and more recently also Africa are playing a growing role on the international stage.<strong> This shift of power towards the Global South is rebalancing relations around and within the Atlantic space<\/strong>. Until recently the North America-Europe transatlantic link was overwhelmingly predominant in the region. North-South relations between the USA and Latin America and Europe and Africa have suffered from a profound asymmetry. However, slowly the space is opening up and multiple levels of engagement are developing across the Atlantic space and with partners in other regions. Regional formats and bilateral partnerships are redrawing the political map of the Atlantic, including a proliferation of South-South links as well as triangulations between advanced, middle income and developing partners (e.g. the trilateral alliance between Brazil, South Africa and India or the BRICS). Large emerging powers such as Brazil reach out to Africa and aim to play a bigger role on global issues in multilateral and mini-lateral fora.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","views":"158","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"1","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-05-02 10:45:00","modified":"2016-02-08

perhaps the predominant trend reshaping the international system. Different authors have offered different readings and conceptualisations of the erosion of American and Western predominance coining concepts such as multipolar world, a post-American world or a non-polar world. ATLANTIC FUTURE adopts a distinct position.<\/p>","body":"<p>ATLANTIC FUTURE adopts the concept of interpolarity, coined by the researcher Giovanni Grevi. It is ATLANTIC FUTURE&rsquo;s assumption that we live in an interpolar world, where multipolarity and interdependence are equally important. On the one hand, by rescuing polarity we are able to defend the central role of the state, which allows, among other things, to account for the rise of China, Brazil and other emerging state powers. On the other hand, interdependence captures the links not only among states but also among non-state actors, and stresses the increasing interconnectedness among international actors and issues and technological advance and the diffusion of power.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Atlantic, the space where American and, before that, European pre-eminence was most evident in the past, is changing fast, and its study can yield useful insights into how interpolarity works in practice. When looking at relations between large and middle powers, sheer balance of power paradigms fit international politics in the Atlantic space less than the more nuanced concept of interpolarity. The latter does not exclude or neglect competition or hard geopolitical considerations, but sets them in the broader framework of interdependence. This is all the more relevant in a context such as the Atlantic where relations between the main state actors are predominantly not defined in antagonistic terms and trans-national threats are largely common ones. An interpolar system is interest-based, problem driven and process-oriented. Focusing on interests does not mean emphasising ruthless self-interest only but also exploring the scope for the convergence of national interests, and relevant incentives. Numerous challenges across the Atlantic require cooperative solutions and awareness of such imperative across different regions, while arguably growing, needs scrutiny. For example, organised crime or climate change affect different countries in different ways.<\/p>","views":"274","shares":"0","tweets":"0","mails":"2","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-05-01 16:24:00","modified":"2016-02-05 22:12:22"},"User":{"id":"1","email":"info@onebigrobot.com","first_name":"Administrator","last_name":null,"password":"c8d482e69d7de06cc7429d3b9484c8145fdfb818","code":"","role":"0","type":"0","published":true,"created":"2014-06-26 10:44:32","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Event":{"id":null,"datetime":null,"country":null,"city":null,"address":null,"map":null},"Resource":[],"ContentTag":[{"id":"1439","content_id":"3","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},{"id":"1428","content_id":"3","tag_id":"123","order":"1","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"123","code":"international-balance-of-power","name":"International balance of power","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-30 09:50:08","modified":"2013-09-30 09:50:08"}},{"id":"1429","content_id":"3","tag_id":"121","order":"2","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"121","code":"interdependence","name":"Interdependence","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 13:12:07","modified":"2013-09-27 13:12:07"}},{"id":"1430","content_id":"3","tag_id":"11","order":"3","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"11","code":"multipolarity","name":"Multipolarity","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:04:11","modified":"2013-09-27 10:04:11"}},{"id":"1431","content_id":"3","tag_id":"42","order":"4","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"42","code":"brics","name":"BRICS","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:56:17","modified":"2013-09-27 09:56:17"}},{"id":"1432","content_id":"3","tag_id":"5","order":"5","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"5","code":"atlantic-space","name":"Atlantic space","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:55:08","modified":"2013-09-27 09:55:08"}},{"id":"1433","content_id":"3","tag_id":"138","order":"6","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"138","code":"europe","name":"Europe","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:16:35","modified":"2013-10-25 10:16:35"}},{"id":"1434","content_id":"3","tag_id":"7","order":"7","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"7","code":"power","name":"Power","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:05:06","modified":"2013-09-27 10:05:06"}},{"id":"1435","content_id":"3","tag_id":"41","order":"8","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"41","code":"actors","name":"Actors","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 09:53:51","modified":"2013-09-27 09:53:51"}},{"id":"1436","content_id":"3","tag_id":"143","order":"9","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"143","code":"america","name":"America","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-10-25 10:41:45","modified":"2013-10-25 10:41:45"}},{"id":"1437","content_id":"3","tag_id":"3","order":"10","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"3","code":"west","name":"West","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"FFFFFF","created":"2013-09-27 10:26:21","modified":"2013-09-27 10:26:21"}},{"id":"1438","content_id":"3","tag_id":"147","order":"11","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","Tag":{"id":"147","code":"international-relations","name":"international relations","type":"0","mandatory":false,"color":"#FFFFFF","created":"2013-11-18 11:32:59","modified":"2013-11-18 11:32:59"}}],"MainCategory":{"ContentTag":{"id":"1439","content_id":"3","tag_id":"44","order":"0","created":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00"},"Tag":{"id":"44","code":"the-atlantic1","name":"The Atlantic","type":"1","mandatory":true,"color":"0068AD","created":"2013-10-30 14:16:17","modified":"2013-08-02 12:27:19"}},"Format":[]},{"Content":{"id":"5","code":"the-thematic-areas-of-atlantic-future","user_id":"1","title":"The thematic areas of ATLANTIC FUTURE","abstract":"<p>Four main areas have been identified as the main potential drivers for cooperation in the Atlantic. ATLANTIC FUTURE will obtain information and a mental map of the trends in these issue areas.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","body":"<p>ATLANTIC FUTURE work focuses on four thematic areas: economy and finance, security, political, social and cultural relations, and resources and environment.<\/p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Economy and Finance<\/em><\/h3>\r\n<p>Economic links are at the forefront of the transformation of the Atlantic world. Changes in global finances are markedly reflected in the region. Global and regional economic growth is at the same time the result of and the stimulus for a large increase in trade flows and their diversification. Financial flows across the region take very different shapes: transfers resulting from trade imbalances, credit and financial investment, FDI, development aid and migrant remittances, to name only the most significant. Each of them is undergoing substantial change across the Atlantic. Tourism is also playing a growing role in linking regions together. All those flows are the background for the emergence of new routes of transportation, both over the sea and by air, and even of pan-Atlantic infrastructure, such as undersea internet cable connections.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Security<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Compared to the Pacific or the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic does not appear as a source of global insecurities or tensions. The relations between most powers in the area are relatively cordial and where there is open antagonism, for example between Cuba and the United States, or open territorial grievances, like between Great Britain and Argentina over the Malvinas\/Falklands or between Spain and Morocco over the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, an open military conflict seems a remote possibility. However, under that quiet surface, a military build-up in Latin America serves as a reminder that not all conventional threats can be safely discarded in the Atlantic. This holds even truer for non-conventional threats. The lethal combination between fragile states, lucrative narcotics smuggling routes and vast sea and land borders that are difficult to control, links the countries on both sides of the Central Atlantic in a vicious circle of violence, poverty, instability and all forms of organised crime. As traffic grows along the Atlantic sea lanes, maritime security becomes a regional and a global concern, in particular in view of the increase in piracy activities in the Gulf of Guinea or drug trafficking across the Atlantic sores.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>People and Institutions<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Large and mid-sized players, notably emerging ones in South America and Africa, pursue a multi-vector foreign policy that result in new diplomatic and political ties. Brazil and South Africa, closely followed by other middle regional players such as Argentina, Colombia or Nigeria, feature multiple identities as developing and middle-income countries, champions of the South, protagonists of the global economy, leaders of regional cooperation and pioneers of new partnerships across the Atlantic as well as with other regions of the world. The North Atlantic actors cannot assume that predominance of democratic governance in Africa and South America will necessarily result in convergence of values and perceptions, and even less in automatic alliances on global issues. Contrasting perspectives on such crucial issues as human rights or democratisation can become significant obstacles to a wider Atlantic cooperation. The proliferation of actors and agendas challenges the traditional approach of the US and the EU towards their Southern neighbours in the Atlantic space but also bears the seeds of new opportunities for cooperation and mutual benefit. A number of variables, both internal and external to the Atlantic space, will determine whether these seeds will bear fruit.<\/p>\r\n<h3><strong><em>Resources and Environment<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p>Energy and climate issues, in particular, have become key Atlantic vectors, as an incipient &ldquo;Atlantic Basin energy system&rdquo; (re)emerges as an important subsystem within the global political and energy economy, alongside the Pacific and Indian Ocean Basin-systems. The energy map of the Atlantic area is one that reflects not only the very different real income and consumption levels of the Atlantic continents, but also the divergent energy economies and distinct energy policy environments and evolutions. Key global trends (including climate change, intensifying competition for resources, the imperative to eliminate poverty) are pushing in the direction of energy policy and regulatory convergence within the Atlantic Basin and toward a deepening of transatlantic energy trade and investment. The Southern Cone and Southern Africa have recently emerged as new centers of gravity within the energy landscape of the Atlantic Basin. Many new energy trends are now emerging in the Southern Atlantic, although the unconventional gas revolution in the United States is shifting energy trade patterns, and the search for renewables on each Atlantic continent also offers considerable potential for transformation. The Atlantic Basin accounts for approximately one-third of both global oil and gas production. Over 40% of world petroleum reserves and nearly 12% of global conventional gas reserves are located in the Atlantic world. These figures are also likely to increase in coming years, as more unconventional oil sources - offshore oil, Arctic oil, and shale gas - are discovered, then classified as proven reserves, and eventually brought online as new production. The Southern Atlantic alone could account for as much as 20% of global energy demand by 2035, with the entire Atlantic Basin contributing nearly half. The expected boom in Southern Atlantic energy demand lends the Atlantic Basin energy space more critical mass within the global energy system.<\/p>","views":"393","shares":"1","tweets":"0","mails":"0","published":true,"image":true,"featured":true,"type":"0","created":"2013-04-19 18:29:00","modified":"2016-02-06
