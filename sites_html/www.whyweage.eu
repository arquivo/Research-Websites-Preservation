research is an area of great socioeconomic and political importance for
Europe. A crucial step to reinforce the constructive results arising
from previous FPs in the Biogerontology area is to establish a road map
for European research on the molecular aspects of healthy human ageing,
also including some relevant aspects of development. Based on an
assessment of the state of the art in molecular gerontology and
breakthroughs in biotechnology, we shall strive to identify the main
research priorities for the next 10 to15 years.&nbsp; <br><br>To
achieve this objective, we shall organise preparatory workshops on
thematic issues before a final summit conference where final texts will
be agreed upon before publication. Each workshop will include intense
discussion on which research directions in each particular field should
be prioritized to obtain maximum benefit within the foreseeable future.
We will facilitate discussion of a &#8220;brainstorming&#8221; nature rather than
on a series of scientific workshops aimed at presenting scientific
results.<br><br>All participants will be asked to prepare their
contributions to the workshop by answering a list of questions sent to
them at least one month in advance. Each thematic workshop will send a
maximum of 4 delegates (2 elected and the 1 or 2 partners in charge of
organizing the thematic workshop) to the final summit conference. These
delegates will carry the messages formulated at their respective
thematic workshops. The negotiated documents emerging from the summit
conference will serve as a reference tool for further support of
European policies on ageing, considering other stakeholders in the
field who will also be invited to participate and share their views. <br><br>Thus,
the main goals of the WhyWeAge workshops are to identify emerging
fields of interest for molecular gerontology which could allow great
scientific achievements and applications of socio-economic interest and
to inform the stakeholders, including the Eropean Commission, dealing with scientific
research via the production of a policy document entitled: &#8216;A road map
for molecular gerontology research in Europe&#8217;<br></div><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Participants call:</span><br><br>The participant call has been edited in the 17 September issue of Nature (paper version).<br><br>If
