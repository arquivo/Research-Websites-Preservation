  <p class="title"><strong>Project Title</strong></p>
  
  <p>Development of a Non-destructive Sensor to Determine Density Gradient of Ceramic Tiles  During Pressing (NOVAPRESS)</p>
  
  <p class="title"><strong>Context</strong></p>

  <p>The occurrence of density gradients in ceramic tiles during pressing is the primary cause of differential shrinkage, lack of  calibre and warpage which lead to losses and/or down-grading     of the final products. Figure 1 shows the effect of density gradients on fired ceramic tiles.</p>

  <p><img src="images/tile-images-for-home-page.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="Figure 1: Example of warped and out of calibre ceramic tiles (in grey) vs a good tile (in green)" /></p>
  
  <p class="label"><strong>Figure 1: Example of warped and out of calibre ceramic tiles (in grey) vs a good tile (in green)</strong></p>

<p>Density gradients are usually caused by poor die  design and/or unsuitable or poor flowability of particulate materials 
which hinder an uniform die filling or unbalance of pressure in the press due to a poor set  up. At present, these faults go undetected until the pieces have been fired.
</p>
 
  	<p class="title"><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
    
    <p>The NOVAPRESS project aims to develop an in-situ sensor to allow the rejection of bad quality tiles to occur before they travel down the glazing/decoration time and onto the  energy-consuming firing process.</p>
    <p>
The sensor system will assist in maintaining the  competitiveness of the European manufacturers of machinery and equipment for  the ceramic industry AND European ceramic manufacturers through a knowledge based  technology lead. Waste of materials and energy will be reduced through improved  control of manufacturing processes, which will be particularly beneficial to  SMEs in their continual quest for survival by increasing efficiency and widen  their client base to include new industrial sectors.</p>

<p class="title"><strong>Final Results</strong></p>
<p>The  NOVAPRESS project is expected to deliver <strong>a novel method for measuring (and  thus controlling) green tile density during manufacture</strong>. <br />
  <br />
The work  performed to date has demonstrated the capability of the NOVAPRESS system to  deliver some of the key features for the system. In particular, The project  successfully delivered 2 prototypes to be used off the press which contain the  necessary technology that enable also to be installed on the press:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The measurement in contact and in direct transmission mode is a  much more accurate and reliable method for measuring the density of ceramic  tiles and other pressed items that other non contact methods available in the  market. An off the press off the line rig was build and demonstrated to work in  tile factory environment.</li>
  <li>The collection of density measurement is fast enough to be used on  line. A second rig was produced in which special roller sensors were engineered  and the signal adapted using a tailor made software control system that enable  the technology to operate in a factory environment. </li>
</ul>
<p>The 2  off the press prototypes were tested in 3 tile manufacturers and successfully  demonstrated that the technologies are capable of considerably reduce the die  set up time, improve productivity and reducing manufacturing cost and waste. A  series of case studies were produced and will be soon published in Ceramic  World Review magazine.<br />
  <br />
  The  final stage of the development project involve the use of the technology into  the press will make possible an immediate detection of density gradients during  pressing.&nbsp; Using this information engineering a reliable feedback control  acting directly on the hydraulic system of the press or the powder feeding  system can be designed. This will result in automatic correlation of the  pressure profile/distribution of the powders into the mould to deliver  well-pressed tiles.<br />
  <br />
  Apart from improving the quality of the manufactured product (happy customer), reduce  waste to landfill (happy environment), LEMA and ELEKTRONINES SISTEMOS expect  the NOVAPRESS system to be applicable to other less mature sectors than tile  manufacturers, such as medical ceramic manufacture, drug pressing etc. opening up new high value markets for the SME participants and generating capabilities  allowing them to enter the new markets. Some demo trials with advanced ceramics (piezoelectric and bioceramics) are now being executed.<br />
<br />
The technology is in the process of being patented by LEMA and a prototype will be showcased by Lema at the forthcoming Tecnargilla exposition.</p>

<p>NovaPress is an EU FP7 project funded under the  Research for the Benefit of SMEs programme. The project finished in May 2012.</p>
