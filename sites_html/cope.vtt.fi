						The objective of the Common Operation Picture 
						Exploitation (COPE) project was to achieve a significant 
						improvement in emergency response management command and 
						control performance, reliability, and cost. New 
						solutions were created by combining a user oriented 
						human factors approach with the technology development. 
						The aim was a step improvement in information flow both 
						from and to the first responder in order to increase 
						situational awareness across agencies and at all levels 
						of the command chain in emergency management situations. 
						A user-driven approach was taken to develop new 
						technologies for supporting user information 
						requirements at the scene of the event. First responders 
						belong to a heterogeneous group in terms of emergency 
						environments as well as roles, command structure, 
						organisational and national differences. The project 
						applied a wide range of human factors methods from 
						functional task modelling to end user simulations to 
						better understand the processes of individual agencies 
						and to ensure that new systems both match requirements 
						and can be integrated with legacy processes and 
						technologies.
						<p>The results show that the objectives of the COPE 
						project were reached. The first sentence of the abstract 
						of the COPE Description of Work sets the frame 
						requirements of the project: </p>
						<p>&#8220;<i>The Common Operational Picture Exploitation 
						(COPE) project will integrate COTS solutions and novel 
						technologies to achieve a step change in information 
						flow both from and to the first responder in order to 
						increase situational awareness across agencies and at 
						all levels of the command chain.</i>&#8221; </p>
						<p>This goal was achieved by<br>
						&#8226; The identification evaluation, screening and selection 
						of a set of different technologies adequate for first 
						responder work<br>
						&#8226; The in-depth analysis of requirements for building the 
						COPE innovative solutions<br>
						&#8226; Several development activities in modifying and 
						adapting the technologies for the purpose of COPE.<br>
						&#8226; An intensive Human Factors effort in regarding the 
						end-users' input in all processes of technology 
						development and verification, and in trial exercise 
						design and validation.<br>
						&#8226; The integration of all components into a demonstrator 
						&#8220;System of Systems&#8221; and the setup of a large scenario 
						based mixed live and tabletop type trial exercise. </p>
						<p>According to the judgement of the first responder 
						end-users and external stakeholders, the system and its 
						components worked to the satisfaction level &#8220;good&#8221; to 
						&#8220;very good&#8221;. Some temporary failures and reductions in 
						functionality were at a level usual for such a complex 
						research project, and did not derogate the detailed and 
						overall result as planned. </p>
						<p>The COPE solutions form a basis for advanced common 
						operational picture (COP) solutions and its status of 
						advancement can be compared to other highly advanced COP 
						projects. Efficient use of the COPE results in real 
						operations will require further customisation for the 
						individual domains of the customers and intensive 
						training of the end-users. </p>
						<p>The COPE dissemination event took place in the PSCE 
						conference in November 2011 (Public Safety Communication 
						Europe, see http://www.psc-europe.eu/index.php?id=378#c885 
						).</p>
&nbsp;<p>The project started in February 
						2008 and ended in February 2011.</p>
