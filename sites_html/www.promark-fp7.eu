		<h1>PROMARK: Genetic prostate cancer variants as biomarkers of disease progression</h1>
		<blockquote>
			<p><strong>PROMARK</strong> is an EU-funded study that focuses on the identification of biomarkers for prognosis and treatment  selection of early prostate cancer. The main objective is to attempt to translate recent  breakthrough findings in prostate cancer genetics into biomarkers of clinical  utility.  Furthermore, first steps will  be taken to try and elucidate the biological role of two of the prostate cancer  risk variants. </p>
		    <p>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in  males in Europe, causing over 87,000 deaths in 2006. Early diagnosis and  treatment are key factors in determining survival but screening methods based  on the commonly-used PSA blood test have low specificity and result in  excessive treatment of localized lesions that might never progress to  symptomatic cancer. <br />
		      Biomarkers that help determine which of the  early stage tumours will remain confined to the prostate and which will  progress to an invasive, aggressive form of the disease are urgently needed.  Using genome-wide association analysis, we have identified 6 distinct common  genetic variants that increase the risk of prostate cancer, some of which may  have a stronger association with severe disease. Furthermore, by comparing the  genotypes of patients with aggressive disease to genotypes of those with a more  indolent form, we have identified a large number of candidate markers of  disease severity. Here, we plan to take all these inherited variants and test  the hypothesis that they can serve as biomarkers for prostate cancer prognosis  and outcome. In addition, we have selected two of these variants for genomic  and functional studies. </p>
		    <p>Specifically, we will 1. Collect DNA and  clinical data from over 8000 prostate cancer cases in four European populations  (Iceland, the Netherlands, Romania, UK) 2. Test the utility of inherited  prostate cancer risk variants as biomarkers of disease severity, progression  and outcome 3. Start dissecting the biological mechanisms that cause increased  prostate cancer risk </p>
		    <p><strong>Expected  outcome</strong><br />
The expected outcome of the project is:</p>
	        <p>1) A collection of samples and clinical information from  over 8,000 prostate cancer cases from different parts of Europe.  </p>
	        <p>2) A new prognostic test that predicts clinical outcomes for localized  prostate cancer more accurately than existing methods. <br />
	          <br />
	          3) Documentation  of the association of genetic risk variants to clinical parameters and  outcomes. </p>
	        <p>4) Increased  understanding of carcinogenesis of the prostate which may lead to the  identification of additional biomarkers or therapeutic targets.</p>
